love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ka8b9z/loopy_high_boyfriend_coming_off_of_anesthesia/,6509,87,"Loopy, high boyfriend coming off of anesthesia","My boyfriend (M21) had a very long, very invasive surgery today. He was under strong anesthesia for nearly 4 hours. They finally call and say we can come see him, but warned us he was EXTREMELY high from the anesthesia.
I (F19) have been with him for almost a year and a half. We tell each other we love each other multiple times a day every day. I have never doubted he loves me. But today was just a new level.
He comes out of the ICU, he doesn’t see me at first, and then the nurse points to me and says “there she is!” He looks at me, begins to cry and reaches his hands out for me like a baby, telling me I was the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen in the whole world, he is so happy to see me, he loves me, he can’t believe I’m his girlfriend, staring at my face, kissing my hands. The nurses told me he couldn’t stop talking about me when he woke up after the surgery. He grabbed my hand the whole way back to his room, and while we are in the room, every single time a nurse came in, he asked them “isn’t she so pretty? This is my girlfriend!! She is so sweet” and I honestly could not keep myself from crying. He was in so much pain, yet he would still grab onto my hand and smile at me from his hospital bed. He would drift off to sleep still holding my hand, then wake up and freak out until I reassured him I was right next to him, and he would just smile so big and adorable and fall back asleep again. I don’t even know if he will remember all of this tomorrow, but I don’t care. I don’t know how I could love this boy even more, but I do.
Just wanted to gush. Thanks Reddit",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1lgpwjn/found_my_soulmate_on_reddit_and_i_will_be_forever/,5426,264,Found My Soulmate on Reddit and I will be Forever Grateful,"Almost two years ago, I posted to a sub-reddit for making friends and was contacted by a guy. I was cautious at first-what if he was yet another online creep who just wanted to send me unsolicited photos of his genitals? But I took a chance and started talking with him anyway-and then never stopped.
He lived in a town three hours away from me and after three months of spending every spare second we could talking online, he made the long drive to take me on our first date. It was love at first sight for the both of us. The kind of legitimate, heart-eyes love at first sight you only see in cheesy rom-com movies. For six months,every single weekend he would either drive down to spend the weekend with me or I would catch a Greyhound to go see him.
We've now been living together for over a year and together for two, are madly in love and talking about getting married. We found each other via a one in a million chance and he is my soulmate, and the absolute love of my life.","['https://preview.redd.it/x0shy0jg588f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ea939028e62fed6cdeba077d92f445f1de1b697a', 'https://preview.redd.it/lx8gmmqg588f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5397ec79135e206e1e38c6439602bc59b7f3258e']"
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1fiyhs2/my_girlfriend_made_me_cry_when_i_came_over_last/,5278,520,My girlfriend made me cry when I came over last night,"I adore my girlfriend. We have a baby on the way, and she is delighted to be a mom. As her pregnancy advances, I notice her becoming more emotionally reliant on me. We planned to move in together when my lease ends on the 30th. Although we still have separate apartments, I sleep at her place often.
I could not stay over last weekend as I had to take a trip out of state. The opportunity finally arrived for me to spend the night with her yesterday. I stopped by after work, and she gave me the tightest hug. We started making dinner as I talked about my trip. She got quiet suddenly and appeared to be distressed.
I squeezed her hand and asked if everything was alright. She looked at me with misty eyes and said she gets anxious when we aren't together. She told me I make her feel safe and she can only sleep when she is in my arms. Her words were so touching that my eyes began to water. I offered to move in this week and promised she would never spend another night without me.
She fell into my chest, and tears flowed while I held her. No one ever made me feel more cherished and loved. She wiped her cheeks and shared a long kiss with me after. I felt her lips curl into a smile, and my heart
exploded
. I am so grateful for this woman. She is the best thing that ever happened to me.",

I went to volunteer this morning and suffered from dehydration, low blood sugar, and heat exposure. I texted my husband that I was starting to feel nauseous. Quickly after I sent that text, I vomited and could no longer look at my phone without feeling faint. I didn't know I was dealing with those three things at once. So, at that time, all I could think about was pulling my hair to help relieve pressure on my scalp in a random parking lot. A kind worker came by and sat with me while I tried not to puke again. She asked me if she could call an ambulance for me. I refused and told her that I could call my husband. She pointed towards the crowd, where the race's finish line was. She said he could enter from that way and come pick me up. I turned my head to where she had pointed and saw my husband practically running towards me. Maybe I had dry eyes; maybe it was the culmination of a long morning. But seeing him come straight for me in a crowd of strangers made my eyes well up with tears. They spilled down my face, and I turned my head down to try and hide the fact that I was crying.
I'm home, in bed, and have been resting since he found me. He told me he'd always take care of me and he has never broken that promise.",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/193fm2a/my_wife_is_a_sahm_and_i_kicked_her_out_of_the/,4359,1325,My wife is a SAHM and I kicked her out of the house,"I M33 am married to my wife 32f
She is a SAHM to three kids. 7,5,3. And I work from home full time and provide for my family.
Through my office door, I can hear the kids definitely challenging her today. Just not listening, extra fussy. I left my office, and I can see all over my wife’s face that she is overwhelmed, stressed and tired.
Sooo. I called off work, gave her my credit card, we both have bank cards. And a joint account that we both use freely. But for today, I think some serious retail therapy is in order. And I will pay the balance off at the end of the month. So I am the one with the credit card. I gave her kiss a hug and kicked her out of the house.
I told her not to come back until she buys something for herself that she truly wants, eats a nice meal, drink a fancy drink, go get a message. Shoot, even book a hotel room for two days just to be by yourself and enjoy peace. Whatever you need to do for your self care, go do it! She gave me a kiss, a hug, didn’t fight me and left in her car.
Will she be back? I’m not sure 😅
Now im going to have a clam but firm conversation with our boys. On why they need to respect their mother. And challenge all of them on what we can do around the house to show her how much we love her. Before she gets back home.( if she comes back)
You see as a dad, I don’t struggle with kids like she does. Granted I work 9-5 so I am not with them all day. But when I do have days off, or let my wife sleep in while I cook the kids breakfast, or their lunch. I don’t get any back talk, attitudes. What I say goes and that’s it. If the kids are getting in each other’s nerves, I give them a warning and they stop. I don’t yell at them or spank them. If my wife and I are together with the kids. It’s calm and quiet. As soon as I leave let’s say to go to the bathroom, store whatever. All Hell breaks loose.
I grew up in a household where my parents were both physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. I wanted to kill myself at age five. My parents were both youth  pastors and prayed, encouraged and uplifted everyone at church. But behind closed doors. It was my hell. I survived suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety. I had really some serious trauma that I needed to work on. And learn how to love and be kind to myself. Admit my mistakes and confront my shame. Nearly killed me again. But made it out. Barley….
Now 33m I haven’t left my faith in God. And I promised my self once I have kids, I won’t be like my parents.
I just feel so sorry for her and the stress she endures. I see her and acknowledge her hardship. I hope she stays out all day today and relaxes.
So how can truly bring it home to my children. That they need to respect their mother?
EDIT #1: my gosh! My DMs are blowing up so positive and some bad. To the positive ones I am enjoying the conversation and all your advice. As well as sharing my life story with you. And hearing your stories as well!
To the bad dms and comments. I am sorry if it came across as me bragging or wanting kudos. This is not the case. I was just telling a story of my day. And legit wanted advice to be a better father.
EDIT #2 : some people are hung on the credit card situation. She has her own credit card. We just paid it off and mutually decided together to do all the big spending on mine. Since we are in a one income household. We kept catch ourselves getting into debt and not communicating properly when we made purchases. So 2024 this was our New Year’s resolution we decided to do together when it comes to credit cards
EDIT #3 : She did come back. I had a baby sitter on standby to watch the kids at night. And I took her to a nice relaxing restaurant and bought stuff at Ulta",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1lpexse/i_never_thought_ill_be_loved_like_this_my_husband/,4074,265,i never thought I'll be loved like this. my husband is literally a dream come true,"I just wanted to take a moment to gush about my husband. Like, extra appreciate him because this man? He’s the literal embodiment of “if he wanted to, he would.”
We’re in a semi-LDR situation. I’m based in Manila, he’s in California. but I’m also a flight attendant for US routes, so I see him almost every weekend due to work. We got married fairly quickly, but he’s been working SO hard to bring me over permanently. If you’ve dealt with visas, you know they require a mountain of money and proof that you can financially provide. And he’s doing all of that without ever making me feel like a burden.
We had a sweet little backyard wedding in the US, very wholesome, very romantic. But since only my mom could fly in, he promised me two weddings, one fulfilled the garden wedding dream(the us one) and another in the Philippines so I could have the family-filled, beachside celebration I’ve always imagined. He didn’t even blink at the idea. He offered.
On top of all that, he still takes me on dates. He spoils me. He bought us a house because I casually mentioned wanting a family someday. He never makes me pay for anything, not because I expect it, but because he wants to take care of me. And he does. In ways I never thought I’d get to experience.
If someone had told me three years ago that I’d be this loved, I honestly wouldn’t have believed it. I was so used to being the strong, self-sufficient one. But life surprised me in the most beautiful way with a husband who chooses me, shows up for me, and loves me so, so loudly.
I’m just really grateful.
TLDR: Married quick, semi-LDR with my US-based husband. He’s working hard to bring me over permanently, gave me a dream garden wedding and is planning a second beach wedding for my family. Buys me things, spoils me, even bought us a house. I’ve never felt so loved.

He automatically said no, which I expected. I said “I know that’s a tricky question” and he replied “yeah, I don’t appreciate that question.” So I told him “I would really like an honest answer” so he stopped and thought about it. He looked at me and said “since the beginning of this relationship we have both gained a little weight” as he grabbed the tummy of his wonderful dad bod “even now, when we are walking in the store, I look at you and think wow. You are the perfect shape. Exactly what I like. However, if you feel the need to eat healthier I will do it with you. I know I can’t go to the gym with you because one of us has to stay home with our son (3yo), but we can start working on being healthier together.” And this brought me peace and gratitude. I just wanted to say “thank you for being honest with me and validating my feelings about my body. Thank you for flowing love into your words about such a sensitive topic. Thank you for loving me enough to make this effort for me. I really will love you forever.” But I just said “thank you baby, that sounds great.”",

If I shift around on the bed and get close to her shoulder, she kisses my forehead immediately.

love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1oig6l2/the_reason_why_i_regret_giving_him_those_wish/,2985,187,The Reason Why I Regret Giving Him Those Wish Coupons,"I gave him that coupon book as a birthday present after we’d been dating for three years (in 2019).
And I’ll tell you why I never made him another one after that.
He simply didn’t use them. Months passed by and I kept asking him why he didn't use them, but he’d just smile and say, “Nah.”
I thought maybe my gift hadn’t impressed him. So I stopped myself from asking him about it to the point I forgot about its existence.
Until one day, he finally used one.
On weekend, in the afternoon, he took me to the restaurant we always went to. Before we walked in, he suddenly handed me the coupon book.
He showed me the last coupon in the book. The most special one I made, the fill-in-the-blank coupon.
I want ________.
(Note: Fill in anything you want. One-time use only.)
He’d written:
You to go have fun with your friends today.
I stared at him, confused. He just muttered ""sorry"", patted my head, smiled, and led me to a table where my friends were sitting.
That’s when I finally understood.
My best friends had planned a meetup. I’d wanted to go but decided not to, because I didn’t want to miss a weekend with him. Every time we said goodbye, we’d already start counting the days until the next weekend, until we could see each other again. So, with a heavy heart, I told my friends to go ahead without me.
I never mentioned it to him, but somehow he found out through one of them.
He greeted them all, introduced himself politely to the one who came from out of town, then said goodbye. Before leaving, he quietly slipped his card into my hand and whispered to me to use it to treat my friends.
My friends didn’t make things awkward, even though they knew I’d chosen him over them before. We had such a good time that day. That memory has stayed with me ever since.
I had hope for him to make use the coupons so I could help him with chores. Even though he was always busy with work, he still cleaned his apartment by himself.

He was just sleeping. His reaction melted me.,"Backstory: I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. So yes, I have a problem, and I am actively working on it through medications and therapy.
My boyfriend always calls me before he goes to sleep. If for some reason he falls asleep without calling, which is very rare, I call him before I go to sleep which has always woken him up. (We only sleep apart from each other once a week).
Tonight for about an hour I couldn’t get a hold of him. Thinking back on it, rationally I should have realized he was probably deeply sleeping as he didn’t get much sleep the night before. But my anxiety convinced me he was dead somewhere.
So my call finally woke him up and I just was a sobbing, blubbering mess. He didn’t once berate me, make excuses, or make me feel stupid. He just apologized (he had nothing to apologize for) and reassured me. I told him i felt crazy. He said that is not true. He told me that my anxiety is part of me and he loves all of me, even the anxiety.
I’ve never felt so reassured and safe. This man understands everything about me, even the parts I don’t truly understand fully. He understands my anxiety without ever having experienced it himself. He amazes me every day.",

She has been very sleepy, hungry, and affectionate lately. I love cooking meals for her and our baby. I love all the extra cuddles and kisses we share. She has no baby bump yet but has put on a little weight. I think she is more beautiful than ever.
She already woke me up a week ago when she had a craving. I made sure I was ready for her the next time that happened. Sure enough, she woke me at three this morning. I saw tears in her eyes and panicked. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she could not sleep. All she could think about was chocolate.
I started laughing. She looked upset, but I told her to hold on a minute. I had stashed some of her favorite chocolates where I knew she would never find them. When I gave them to her, her eyes lit up and she hugged me tightly. Seeing her smile and enjoy her candy was the cutest thing ever.
We cuddled after and kept giggling about how absurd that moment was. She fell asleep before long, but I stayed up a while and held her. Her quiet snoring may be my favorite sound. It embarrasses her, but I find it adorable. I love my girlfriend so much. We had some rough patches, but I am happy we found each other again. She is my everything.",

I couldn’t stop smiling. I leaned forward and gave her a hug and a kiss on the head, stroking her hair and telling her how sweet she was and how soft her lips were. That was my first kiss, and hers too, and it felt wonderful.
She said that it had taken a lot of courage for her to do that, but that she was glad she did. With me, of all people!

She's a doctor, grasps concepts after just a single round of practice, and can throw snark and sarcasm without missing a beat. She has a plan for every situation, and it's honestly inspiring how all that planning is backed by sheer willpower and stubbornness. She's also super talented and plays the piano almost like a pro despite only practicing for a few months (even her trainer says that she's one of his most talented students.)
But when she's around me she just ""turns off,"" to the point where I need to walk her around as she clings onto me and sometimes literally pull her out of traffic. Even cuter, she goes from full sentences to lovey-dovey talk or excitedly tripping over her words to tell me about her interests or how her day went, which makes me absolutely melt. Sometimes when she's really tired she just collapses in my arms and we just cuddle together whilst making weird/funny noises at each other.
I love how she's not afraid to show me both sides- the mature medical professional as well as the 2013 Tumblr girl.

love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/18wxs3b/today_i_learned_grief_is_the_toll_we_pay_for_love/,1983,280,Today I learned grief is the toll we pay for love.,"I sit here in tears today grieving the end of my 8 year relationship.
We met as strangers on the internet. We had our first FaceTime just a day after exchanging emails. I’ll never forget it. We are just 5 years apart in age.
8 months later we signed a lease on our first apartment together. It was nicer than anything either of us had ever stayed in. It was our home.
We texted everyday “I love you” and “I love you more”. It was unlike any relationship I had ever had. It felt safe, and l felt loved. Sure we have our arguments but it tore us both apart to not be connected. The arguing would end in “I’m sorry” and “I hate being apart from you”.
The pandemic hit and while many couples hated being locked up together, we found ways to have fun. We would shoot nerf guns at red solo cups we setup as targets. We started saving to buy a house.
Then one day I got a message through Facebook from someone who said I was being cheated on. Sure enough it was true. My heart broke. I decided to forgive and we moved on.
We got engaged, we bought our first house and took the in laws to Italy. Life was good but I had trust issues which then affected our sex life. We went to therapy but we still argued.
And then late in 2023 I get a text from another person letting me know I’ve been cheated on. It was true. That’s when I ended it.
Of course I’m leaving so many details out because I don’t want this to be a longer post than it already is but I want to say this to all of you looking for love…
1) love with your whole heart. Love deep. Love is a risk and if I had the choice to do this all over again knowing how it would end, I would. But I’d still leave. True vulnerable love is the most beautiful and fullfilling feeling you can have.
2) don’t take any moment for granted. Looking back, I did. I assumed that we’d always have each other and I regret focusing on work so much.
3) no one is perfect. Own up to how you played a part in any arguments. Remember why you love each other.
And I’ll leave you with this…you’ll know if you truly loved because in the end (whether death or breakup) you’ll have to pay the toll and it’s grief. And it’s deep deep grief but it’s so worth it.
Edit: to everyone telling me to get therapy, just stop. My post isn’t about asking for your help. Everyone’s journey is different and I alone made a very conscious choice to remain in my relationship. I’m not blaming anyone for my choices. That’s what being an adult is. My post left out many details for brevity sake so I’ll mention here that the heavy grief is being felt on both sides. We hold each other and cry so hard some nights. Yes we still live together.

I hope we have a good life. The kind we both deserve.
There isn't much of a wedding (we are broke ass students) but im gonna take her watch the perseids tonight. Drive out of town somewhere dark. Maybe in a few years I can take her somewhere much nicer to look at the stars but this'll do tonight.
Im sorry if I posted in the wrong place, I just wanted to get this out of my system. Im just happy.

Courthouse was quick, got a yes and a kiss and a wife and a future. Ok well we're silly pranksters at heart so I got a ""well yuuuuuup"" instead of the usual ""I do"". Love that damn woman.
We went for a coffee after the ceremony. Just talking crap and laughing at eachother. Now a bit of naptime and maybe out for a drink before stargazing.
Gonna go buy her chocolate tho. 
She loves chocolate.",

My husband is next to me currently. He has a habit of rolling over in his sleep and cuddling me. He's never aware of it nor remembers. However tonight I'm reminded of when we first met. Earlier today he mentioned that he's at peace when he's near me. And for some reason I couldn't figure out why that perplexed me.
Well just a few minutes ago I remembered when we first met. I remember when he hugged me. To comfort me. He said he was at peace and that his soul felt drawn to me even though we had just met.
I have tears rolling down my face now.  I read that that feeling can be described as ""coming home"". Because that means whatever he had been searching for he found in me. And whenever he drifts off he searches for me subconsciously. 
I do NOT deserve this man but I'm grateful for him every day.
Edit: Words cannot express how surprised and blessed I feel with everyone's stories and encouragement on here. So much so it's hard to respond to each and every one of you. Without going into too much detail, I struggle and have struggled based on my past experiences as a child and an adult. Its amazing you all picked up on it to a small extent.

We have been together since we were 20, over 12 years now (married 7) and we just recently adopted our perfect little son.
I grew up with pretty low self-esteem, and I still find it hard to accept all the love and support I recieve on a now daily basis. My wife always mentions how she hopes our son will grow up just like me and that she is so happy to raise a kid together.
The crazy thing is that she is so into me that even objectably lame things that I like have become ""cool"" to her. I found a ""ManBat"" while thrifting action figure, a batman villain and she wouldn't stop talking about how happy she was I found it, and then when I was on a video call with my buddy she couldn't help but show off my find.
Also she is super hot so that's cool too.

and she's absolutely amazing. She's sweet, kind, shares my humour, she's an amazing artist ( she want's to be a tattoo artist ) and not only is she drop dead beautiful she's also crazy intelligent.
​
I'm so glad to say for the first time in years I can finally smile, every time we're apart I count the seconds till we talk again, every morning she sends me good morning texts, she is literally the best thing to ever happen to me and yes she knows about my mental health and supports me through my dark times.
​
I know some of you will say "" bro it's just the honeymoon phase "" or something more grim like "" nothing last forever"" and some might call me a simp but I don't care. I know finally having a relationship is not going to cure my depression but for once there is a ray of sunshine peering through my dark clouds and I'm gonna fight to keep it.

I was feeling sad over something irrelevant and at the time I was living away from my mom in a different city. I came home and she immediately noticed. She didn’t even ask what happened the only thing she said to me was that she knew and that she was there for me
Through a clenched throat and gutted tears my mom told me that above even my dad that she felt like I was her soulmate. She told me that she felt like she waited her entire life for me to come to her and that no one else she’s ever been close to has had such a connection to her that she’s had with me
This obviously made me immediately start to cry and i told her I felt the exact same way and that I feel like we had probably been through multiple lives together  while hugged and both had tears running down our face.
I don’t know, I know it feels probably dry to type this out but I didn’t  know where to share it. Lucky me that my mom said this to me but I just feel like it goes to show, you dont always have to meet the “right person” to find this kind of love and connection. Sometimes, they’re right there next you in your family.
This being said, going into the new year I feel so incredibly lucky to be alive and to have felt something like this in my life. I hope anyone who reads this feels loved and knows that they really are the center of someone’s universe and that there’s no definition of what a soulmate should look like.
If you love someone tell them, and make that a priority in your life no matter who it is, there’s too much hatred that exists out there otherwise. Big love going out to everyone in the new year, you deserve it more than anything else.",

I simply put my phone to charge in the bedroom and went into the shower not thinking much of it. It had been a long week and I honestly just wanted to get the shower out of the way so I could lay down. The next thing I know, I can hear one of my favorite songs playing and my bf walks into the bathroom with his phone and a playlist of some of my favorite songs. He left the phone in there with me and told me to enjoy my shower. I know it’s such a small gesture (and it is definitely not the first time he’s done something so thoughtful) but after a rough week, it made me cry. The fact that he remembered my favorite songs and then left his phone in the bathroom with me just so I could relax after a long day is something that I will never forget. I love him so much.",

She said that she hopes they don’t make me wait long. I said thanks and went to pick up the order.
It took about 15 minutes for me to get the food, but when I came out she said “I knew they were going to make you wait!” I think I just laughed and walked away. Idk.
Then she calls out to me and says “hey, would a hug make you feel better” I was fine so I’m not sure what she meant but I told her she could if she wanted to. Then we hugged and before she walked away, she gave me a kiss on the neck and said something about getting more tips.
Now this wasn’t like a sloppy love making kiss, it was more like a quick peck. But it literally didn’t make sense what happened. I’m not good looking, I’m not fit, I don’t stand out. Only thing I can think of is that maybe she was drunk. But it was the middle of the day so I’m not sure.
All I know is that I was BRICKED for the next half hour, also that it made me feel like someone wanted me. I was stressing over some shit that happened earlier and that just blew everything away.
I know this reads as a “and then every one clapped” story but I don’t care. I will literally remember this moment for the rest of my life.",

This happened 2 days ago
I, 29M have a really close friend 29F. We've been friends since 20. We hang out most often and have sleepovers. She's kinda socially awkward and we're each other's best friend. We watch movies together, have drinks, beer mostly and share everything with each other, fight occasionally too. Even our parents mistook us for a couple, but we never imagined it in our wildest dreams.
All these times we never had any feelings to each other, at least that's what I thought and we have not dated anyone else. A year ago unexpectedly we started sleeping together, we became FWB. People say its really bad to be FWB with your best friend but in our case it dint ruin our friendship or made anything weird. Actually we sleep together and for us it was very casual, like playing a video game together.
And last month things took a turn. I went to her apartment (she's hardly 2 kilometers away) to hangout as usual and she seemed upset.
She was pregnant!
She cried to me, apologized but I tried to be a supportive friend. I dint blame her or anything cuz it's my responsibility too. Although I acted brave with her I've never slept a wink till yesterday.
Thought of having a kid terrified me (she was too). We haven't told our mum and dad yet but we're telling them tomorrow.
To the incident of today, for the last month I have been contemplating on my life till that time, about why I'm still single, why we've been sleeping together etc. At some point at night, I imagined a situation some guy marries a girl he made pregnant and suddenly I don't know why I replaced those people with us. That moment, I thought about how my life would be if we were a couple. I felt a little joy inside. I think that's how everyone feels about a person the love. I thought about all of our interactions for the last few years and it hit me hard why others took us for a couple. I was startled and felt awkward when I realised I have feelings for my best friend. I was really tensed, we're both strangers to romance and I was terribly scared to tell her.
Some thing happened an hour ago, following and someone on reddit, I talked to her, mustering all the courage I can. I thought she will freak out and we never speak to each other again.
But she wept, hugging me. She couldn't even speak properly when she said she loved me all this time, for years. I couldn't stop shedding some tears too even though I tried to look tough.
She told me she was scared sick I might reject her. Said she always dropped hints.(I swear dint even realise it.) When I told her she said, ""You son of a b**ch I've been loving you for over six years""!. I could not not drop my jaw.
Anyway we promised to raise the kid together and make our relationship official and go on a date tomorrow evening. We don't know shit about dating but we are very optimistic about our future.
I don't know if there will be a marriage in the future but we sure see us together.
Edit: someone told me to asked her to write her side of the story. She agreed to post it soon",

We are in the middle of planning a wedding, and I’ve had a really bad situation with a coworker being inappropriate. It’s been a really stressful time. The stress hasn’t made me the funnest person to be around and we’ve had some bigger than normal arguments.
I’m not used to people being willing to put in work in a relationship. I’ve been left a lot. I’ve been afraid he would leave me with everything going on. We closed on our house on Wednesday, and due to a clerical error his name got left off all the documents. We have to go back in six weeks and pay a 200 dollar fee to add his name to the house. He could leave me at anytime because currently, he’s free and clear. I’m the only one stuck.
We don’t have any furniture yet. We have been sleeping on the floor. It hurts his back and he’s been saying how uncomfortable sleeping on the floor is. So. ....We borrowed an air mattress from a friend. It’s SMOL. I’m used to sleeping on the floor. I lived in my car for a year. It’s not the most comfortable. But I can tolerate it pretty well. I let him sleep on the air mattress last night because I wanted him to be comfortable. Or bed is supposed to get delivered Monday.
This morning, I woke up with him next to me on the floor. Snuggled up against my back. He said he couldn’t wait until Monday to sleep next to me. He slept on the floor just to cuddle me.  I’m full of doubts and insecurities but he always seems to make them better. I cried this morning when he said that. We may be going through an extremely stressful time right now but I love him and he loves me. I slept on the floor so he could be comfortable. He slept on the floor because he wasn’t comfortable without me.

I found it yesterday in an album; I hadn't seen it for a number of years.  We had been married and living together for at least six months before we actually had our wedding ceremony...the delay was mainly for logistical reasons.  The picture is from the middle of our honeymoon trip that we started a few days after the ceremony.
In our hotel room in Papeete before heading out for the day
It is hard for me to look at this photo and not feel terribly nostalgic.  Being so young and happy and optimistic and so much in romantic love.
We are both 26 in this picture, and my wife passed away when she was 40, but this post is not about that, at least, as much as I can separate what I feel about different types of love from my specific feelings of missing her.
I did eventually remarry, to a wonderful woman who I also loved (and still do...she is my current wife).  And she loves me.  I was overall happy being married the first time, so I think it was only natural that I be open to remarrying, and I was fortunate to find a second someone who would take this weirdo that I am (and my three children) into her heart and choose to make a life with me (us).
But even if my first wife was still alive, it is inevitable that love matures and evolves.  The realities of raising children and finances and responsibilities and obligations inevitably turns life from a fairy tale into ...well, life.
I have no way to know, but if my wife in the picture above was still here and 61, would she still snuggle in tight for a photo, cheek to cheek, one arm draped over my shoulder and the other carelessly resting on my leg?  Well, perhaps she would, because I have noticed that in photos of the two of us, she *always* is holding my arm or touching my shoulder or otherwise making physical contact with me...she was very good at just naturally posing in an unforced, intimate manner.
But momentary photos aside, I know from the 14 years that we did spend together that of course we were not the same young lovey-dovey newlyweds at 39 that we were at 26.  And I know that is the natural course of things.
But I really enjoyed that time, that kind of love.  The yearning when apart, the pleasure of shopping for a special romantic gift, the love letters, the affectionate nicknames, leaving silly notes on the kitchen table before going off to work...I do have to admit it makes me sad that I won't experience that sort of love again.
There is nothing stopping me from doing similar things now, other than the fact that my current wife is a different individual with her own style and desires and needs, and most of those things would evoke eye rolls more than a smile.  Romantic, playful love is not really on her menu, if I am frank.  And that is OK, because our love is no less genuine...it is just different...calmer, maybe.  The product of a different time of life, different circumstances.
But I  guess I am lucky to have been so lucky, twice.",

I've always loved him but lately I feel like I'm just head over heels for him like when we were younger. My stomach gets butterflies and I almost feel sick just from thinking about him, like the jitters you get before you meet up with a new boyfriend. When we are in a room together I can feel the electricity between us almost like a magnet just pulling us together. During Thanksgiving I couldn't help looking at him from across the room and doing little things to catch his attention. I think he feels it too, as he's been very vocal about wanting me and any chance he gets he'll come up and touch me or kiss me. He's always been more affectionate than me but lately it's been taken up several notches. I've caught him several times staring at me, checking me out, and looking love struck. Complimenting and asking why I'm moving a certain way and why I'm teasing him when to me I'm just going about doing my normal chores. I don't know what's going on with us but I hope this feeling stays.",

A little backstory- I told her I have aspirations to join the navy, and when I do, I'll be away for a while, and then after seeing her for a little bit after Bootcamp, I'll be on active duty for 4 years and will only see her every now and again when she comes out to visit or I go home on saved up leave.
As she spoke through the tears, she said she didn't want me to go and that she loved me so much. I just held her for what seemed like forever and I just rocked her back and forth on my lap for over an hour as she cried and I consoled her.
I loved this girl more than anything. We just cuddled until her sobs turned into smiles and I told her I was going to marry her someday (we have talked about this before) she just smiled and hugged me.
And Jesus, you best believe me when I tell you this girl is the most stunning thing you could ever see. She looks so cute and innocent when she weeps, I just have an urge to comfort her.",

Some backstory, I’ve known him since around February. I met him in one of my classes and I could instantly tell he was shy/introverted/a little awkward which didn’t bother me. I started talking to him originally about the class and the worksheets we had but then it switched to different things like some things we enjoy.
Well since about the beginning of may, I started to catch feelings for him. I know it’s taken him that long to open up by I feel like that’s a big part of my initial crush for him. I’ve seen him open up to me from hiding in his shell all the time to coming out and showing me his true self. I feel so special knowing I’m one of the only people on this planet who can see who this shy, sweet, intelligent guy really is. It was around that time that I started to realize what a hidden gem I had discovered.
So a couple months go by, my crush seemingly getting bigger with each passing day. Until I finally decided to just go and ask him out on a date. Nothing special or fancy, it was just us two at Dave and busters. Even his reaction was adorable! When I asked him, his cheeks flushed red and he had a smile on that he couldn’t wipe off.
Everything went amazingly well during the date! I dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt which got another cute reaction out of him. He blushed when he saw me and was a little speechless because he’d never seen me dressed up.
We got some food to eat and we played a bunch of games throughout the store until we headed back home. I held his hand as we walked back to the valet. Again he blushed, smiled, and gave my hand a little squeeze. I seriously can’t get enough of his reactions to doing little things like when I kissed him goodbye, It was like a computer resetting with tons of blushing cheeks🥰.
He actually told me I was special to him because of the date and also the fact that I was the only person who decided to stick around and watch him come out of his shell and open up to someone. He likes that I’d invite him to go eat somewhere or hangout after class made a difference to him which is why around mid-April he started having feelings for me too.
Ugh I seriously can’t get enough of that boy and how the smallest sign of affection will make him all happy and blush. It makes me feel special too because my previous partners wouldn’t care for those little acts of affection where it makes his week if I kiss him. 🥰🥰 I’m just so happy right now 😊",

My husband and I recently moved into a little tin can of a trailer. (I love her, she's a wonderful little box.)
While we were unpacking, my husband found a picture of himself as a little tyke with his old baseball team. Maybe six years old.
He handed me the picture with a little smirk, and asked me to pick him out of the group.
Immediately, I noticed that one child was just adorably beautiful. He looked like a little doll. Soft, sweet features. Just. ADORABLE. But I thought, no no. I can't just pick the prettiest one.
So I looked for the most mischievous looking kid, and pointed. He laughed, and told me to try again.
I said, ""Wait, you aren't ACTUALLY just the prettiest one, are you!?"" Of course, dude was a bit flabbergasted, and asked, ""What???""
I pointed to the prettiest one, and said, ""That one!!! The one that looks like a damn child model!"" That was, indeed, my husband. And he was flustered for the next hour or so, lol.

We hadn't seen each other in a couple days but had been fighting mainly over the phone, and the next time we saw each other it was with a group of people, so we didn't really get a chance to air it out in person until later that night. When we were finally alone and he got into my bedroom, I sighed and closed the door, ready to hash it out with him. Really give him a piece of my mind, yknow? I took off my jacket though and he just stared at me and my cute outfit, took off his glasses, then came up and kissed me so passionately I nearly melted into the floor. He basically told me he was sorry but he couldn't stop himself because I looked so good and he loved and missed me.
Guys.
Guys.
Honestly despite rehearsing what I was going to say to him beforehand, I completely forgot my whole speech. I completely forgot what the dumb fight was even about. Hell I'm pretty sure for a while there, I completely forgot my own name. I think I blacked out for a bit because my heart was beating so fast. I felt like freaking anastasia steele when she was kissed in that elevator (fifty shades is a terrible movie but that scene was hot af).
And because we don't really like having sex without fixing our issues, we managed to keep our hands off eachother for long enough to laugh about what a stupid fight we were having and to really discuss it all. He triple checked with me that I was okay with everything before proceeding to blow my mind again...if you know what I mean. Can't believe how lucky I am that we're this in love after being together for 7 years.  :)",

He said he was falling out of love with me, and he doesn't think he'll ever be in the same mental state to love me again. I asked if he was willing to go to couples therapy or therapy in general. He doesn't think anything will help.
To be honest, there were signs. He became distant. We would still have good chats, but he rarely initiated physical intimacy (hugs, kisses). He would rarely initiate sex either. He told me, at one point, he was trying to avoid me.
It hurts. It hurts being the person who still has so much love to work and fight for the relationship, but not getting any of that back. It hurts not being able to grow old with him, to grow with him, to face any challenges with him. It hurts watching him pull away, and me playing it off as tiredness.
I hate feeling this way. It feels like a rug was pulled under me. It's hard to fight back the tears.

Tonight, after we finished watching a movie and were getting ready for bed, I told my partner I’d be sleeping on the couch again. I told her she should go upstairs and sleep in our bed because I was pretty sure she didn’t want to deal with sleeping sitting up. She agreed that I was right.
We hugged for a while since we were both feeling a bit sad about not being able to sleep together that night. During the hug, I joked, “If you start crying, I’m going to laugh.” She looked at me with tears already on her face and said, “Too late.” We both ended up laughing at her crying.

I called my girlfriend last night and told her that I got the offer, and that I was considering taking it, partially as a joke. As soon as those words left my mouth, I noticed that she got really quiet and I asked her what was wrong. I noticed tears in her eyes, and she started crying. I immediately felt terrible and apologised. In that moment, I truly realised how much I meant to her, and how much it would hurt if I was to not be around in her life. I told her that she had no need to worry and that I wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon. She said to me that she could not imagine a life without me, and my heart melted.
We spent the rest of the night talking and planning our first romantic getaway in the countryside, and she told me how excited she was to sit by a campfire and watch the stars with me.  Honestly, I had no idea that she loved me this much. And it hurts me so much as well imagining a life without her. I love her so damn much.

I just wanted to clarify a few things. Firstly, although when I wrote this it sounds like I turned down the opportunity purely because of her, that’s not entirely true. The opportunity was not anything that would boost my career anymore than the role I have now, and honestly I have a great living situation where I am now and wasn’t willing to sacrifice it. Secondly, after she cried, she did express that she was thinking of options to be closer to me if I took the opportunity. We also discussed other options if other opportunities like this arose. I know it’s early, but things are looking up so far!",

If I even mention I might like it, he’s already bought it for me. He checks and changes my oil because he knows I’ll never remember to do it myself and never lets me go to work without caffeine because he knows I’ll have a headache. I’m so taken care of.
I forgot what it feels like to have a relationship that makes you feel better. I’m smiling for no reason. Coworkers have commented on it. I feel prettier. I try harder. My house is cleaner. I have a generally better attitude. I’m sleeping better. I am so fucking STOKED to be in this relationship.
I have to marry him. He’s it. I just know it.",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ibrr4d/i_got_my_bf_an_award_on_one_of_his_comments_on/,1337,23,I got my bf an award on one of his comments on reddit and he doesn’t know it was me.,"He sent a really giddy and adorable message to thank the person who gave him the award. He is unaware that I’m the one who did it. Apparently it was his first award on here. It’s a small thing really, but it was still cute to see him giddy like that. He brushes it off in person, but I’ve got the message that shows how he really felt lol.
Sorry if this seems stupid. It just tickled me to know that small act made him happy.
Edit: thank you all for the upvotes and everything lol. I didn’t realize this post would gain so much traction, so I was worried for a bit that my bf would see this and know it was me, but there has been no mention of the award since posting this so I think I’m in the clear! Would have added this sooner but since this is my second account, I don’t see what all goes on here unless I switch over to it.",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ir9evr/my_boyfriend_carried_me_to_a_hotel_room_while_i/,1335,17,My boyfriend carried me to a hotel room while I was sleeping,"Me (f24) and my boyfriend (m21) went on a visit to his parents house as we haven't seem them in so long. The car drive there was around two days, and we saw lots of sights and enjoyed every moment of it.
My favorite memory was when we where in the middle of the desert on an empty road. All we ahead of us was pitch black and the tail light. After hours of talking and listening to music,  I start to fall asleep in the passenger seat but wake up shortly after to him singing to songs I had no idea he was interested in, word for word. I pretended to still be asleep because seeing him happy made me feel happy inside.
An hour later he pulls up to a hotel, got all our stuff into a room and then came to me. He still had no idea I was awake (I think) and he carried me between his arms to the room. He was struggling but it was still super cute! He lied me down, tucked me in, and kissed me on my forehead. After that, I he fell right into the bed next to me, with all his clothes still on . I kept staring at him the whole night.
When I woke up my heart was filled. I went to cuddle him and he acted so confused to why I was so happy. Looking back at it, he probably did know I was awake, but I didn't want to ruin it. :)",

Friday evening my boyfriend and I got into a huge, huge fight that ended with me leaving in tears. No yelling, no verbal abuse, nothing. Just very emotional.
I must have caught a stomach bug or ate something bad, because Friday night til Saturday evening, I was vomiting my guts out. I literally couldn’t move a muscle without having to puke.
I texted my boyfriend that I was feeling awful and he immediately rushed over with medicine. He built me a little bed next to the toilet, rushed out for some stomach safe food, held my hand while I shivered with a fever. He swaddled me when I was freezing, held ice to my head when I was burning up. He ran out to grab some stomach safe food again and gave me ice chips.
I wanted to apologize for my part in our fight and he just stroked my hair and said everything was okay. I asked him if he was mad and he said no, he was just worried about me. And that he would always love and support me, no matter what.
I have never felt so supported in my entire life. So completely accepted and fully and deeply loved. It’s nice, knowing that I have someone who is in my corner unconditionally.",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1huu6cs/i_cried_in_front_of_my_gf_and_she_comforted_me/,1324,87,I cried in front of my GF and she comforted me,"Yesterday, my GF came over to my house to spend some time with me and some of my family. While waiting for some of my family members to arrive, my GF and I were cuddling in my room with me on top of her while she ran her fingers through my hair. It was the first time I’ve ever felt such an immense feeling of comfort, safety, and happiness that I, no matter how hard I tried, started to cry. My GF obviously noticed and asked me what was wrong. Out of embarrassment, I didn’t want to answer and hugged her tighter instead. I guess she understood since she began to comfort me and began to whisper in my ear how much she loved and appreciated me. Today, she texted me and asked me if I got emotional because of something she said or did wrong, and I reassured her it was the opposite and explained the real reason. She then told me she always wanted to make me feel safe, cherished, and loved, and that she was very happy I was vulnerable with her. I’ll never know what I did to deserve such a loving and amazing girlfriend, but I really, really love her and always will. Just wanted to share this for y’all, thanks for reading!",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1o5wfrg/it_cost_less_than_5_to_create_a_core_memory/,1306,18,It cost less than $5 to create a core memory,"People tend to have the notion that “grand gestures” have to be expensive, extravagant, and unattainable, but this is your PSA that the most meaningful acts don’t have to cost much, if anything.
This weekend, my boyfriend turned 32. He had it pretty rough growing up, and wasn’t often celebrated in his home or by his family. He doesn’t care much about his birthday- why buy a gift? Why go out? Who cares, it’s just another day on the calendar.
I care. It’s not just another day to me.
It cost exactly $4.16 to buy some balloons and a couple numeral candles to place on a breakfast casserole I made, since he’s not super into sweets. In the early morning hours of his birthday, it cost less than thirty minutes of my time to sneakily blow up balloons in the next room with his daughter, both of us giggling, excited and anticipating his reaction.
Yes, the gifts and cards cost extra; and I suppose the ingredients for the breakfast I made. The “happy birthday” banner was free from previous use. But for less than $5, I got to surprise my love with a room full of balloons and see his smile light up with joy. I got to celebrate him, and remind him he is worth celebrating, which costs nothing really. Yet it’s so priceless.
This is your reminder to go the extra mile for the ones you love. Cherish them, celebrate them, adore them, and remind them what a blessing they are to your life. It feels so good ❤️",https://i.redd.it/ivyjlcr63yuf1.jpeg

Happy 29th birthday to me. I hope to celebrate it online with you guys. If I had money on me I’d walk to the store and get myself cake or even a pie and sing myself happy birthday. But I’m not dwelling on the sad stuff today and only hoping for a better new journey for me. Here’s to 29 and happy birthday to me💃🏾
Update:
Honestly I never thought Reddit would in any way make me feel so loved and special. When I posted this I was so happy to have 3 people respond and then it just blew up from there. You guys are all amazing! You’ve taken the time out of your day to wish me a total stranger a happy birthday and believe me when I say you all made it the best birthday ever! For this I am grateful. For this I am thankful. I would have cried myself to sleep but  instead I took your advice, celebrated myself by popping popcorn and watching a movie&later BBT. Fell asleep in the middle of doing so and woke up to more messages! I had one friend reach out, a former classmate and the security guard from my former university via Facebook. Honestly redditors this world is a better place with all you in it! Thank you so much for making me feel that I’m not alone. I wish to do the same for all of you. Thank you so very much❤️. 29th year journey around the sun begins.",
