The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats.
This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.
