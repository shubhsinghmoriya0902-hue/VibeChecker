She works full time as a self employed blogger and I wanted to give her a room she could enjoy working in. I love DIY work, and somehow thought I could completely finish this project in 5 days. While looking after the kids. Wow. Not even close.
She returned just after I got the drywalling completed.
After the shock of what happened to her room went away, she helped me paint, put in the flooring and build some furniture. We went all white to help the light fill the room for photos and videos.
All in all, while I didn't even come close to surprising her with a finished room, it was an overall success and we love the room.
We still need to put in a ceiling, but it's back to working for now!","['https://preview.redd.it/rt7iwjco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=18766a28c479cf5c3e2c571bf86bb7420a2872f0', 'https://preview.redd.it/p6tzrkco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4e8fc3615409682a0c9cbd1d7867c3ac758d5617', 'https://preview.redd.it/agdhqlco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=04f52fb0cca66cc027b42b3e155b0fa83852085b', 'https://preview.redd.it/fbvfknco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a67072fca84517b2e3c9150d0c9a1187c11da261', 'https://preview.redd.it/8fzeknco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=dbe4e0f7921ff371bbb5c175d92e08443a4addef', 'https://preview.redd.it/kvy69yco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9bc3bc35abb80a8eab4c988c0098b0db41ebff63', 'https://preview.redd.it/hqrp3rco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e16a3ea3c75a10410ceb2a763cdd438c6be935fe', 'https://preview.redd.it/lbdnwrco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d86498f236bdbdc3222fb130290cc3ebe67b7d32', 'https://preview.redd.it/t3e6urco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=92ce1ef3584d722cb7ff1c52c07b45079057c47c', 'https://preview.redd.it/dtbk1yco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c98bcede132e3fde1b1e25a208229aee4842c089', 'https://preview.redd.it/pnaen3do3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c80a614b30d680a454856401ebb41049a55f9e3a', 'https://preview.redd.it/sfntrvco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a8e65251a0b89a143952b466ff857c8ef0ace875', 'https://preview.redd.it/kfmy24do3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4704663aa20e1f452661c3cc220d14752f3989c1', 'https://preview.redd.it/4aiy34do3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=547693a436899b0aadba516156faecafb60ffac0', 'https://preview.redd.it/afgu24do3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=93fb87743f1bce8bb5d6218e0e20c25c65374983', 'https://preview.redd.it/0mhux3do3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4aec55cce86e8e297aa6b27515c2c5c694998b5f', 'https://preview.redd.it/hvtaull05xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b6afcf43a258cbae0056c172a46e9cc21d87ba8d', 'https://preview.redd.it/myq3qn1v4xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6bb6526239c9483826750d51aad9af84d7a06248', 'https://preview.redd.it/uttmkuco3xqe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a15bb124d15769d2f939771695ff5e7304fd1e09']"

Call a handful of local companies in the area, have them quote us on fishing a 24'x12' rectangle of the basement, review the quotes...and pick one that seemed reasonable.
We wanted nothing special. Nothing lavish. A finished rectangle with lights, outlets, and a durable floor. A rec space for the kids, a place to have movie nights, and a bonus spot for family to stay while in town.
Nope.
Over a dozen calls were met with no shows or no responses, showing up 4 hours late to 5pm appointments, degrading comments about the space, requiring features we didn't want or need (bathroom or wet bar), and 4 quotes over fifty thousand fucking dollars.
Partially out of spite, with zero experience or knowledge on anything 'handy', I started looking into what it may cost and the cost associated with each step along the way.
The number came to just under $7,500
0
in materials, budget tools that I didn't have, truck rentals to get everything to my house, and an electrician friend to handle the lights and outlets.
I put everything on paper, convinced my (hesitant) wife to let me try, and decided to give it ago.
For the last 4 months I've spent pretty much every second of free time (and what wasn't supposed to be free time) working on the space, watching how-to's on Youtube, and combing through reddit threads and online forums.
Watching it start to come together was an incredible feeling. Building confidence with each step was extremely rewarding.
Last Friday the couch arrived and we held out first movie night.
Edit: This got way more attention than I ever would have expected. Thank you all for the kind words.

DIY,https://old.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1heisjb/rental_remodel_after_nightmare_tenant/,37538,1316,Rental Remodel After Nightmare Tenant,"I had a tenant who adopted six pit bulls from the local animal shelter without my permission.  The dogs did a ton of damage to the house.  The tenant did her share of damage as well.
The first few pics are the day I got the house back.  (I don't have a picture of the bathroom from that day, so I added one from the day I bought the house).
I did a full remodel myself.  Framing, wall/removal & beam install, insulation, tile, cabinets, countertops, kitchen/bathroom flooring, plumbing, electric, new LED lighting & fixtures, appliances (purchased and repaired from FB marketplace), vanity, toilet, reglaze tub, furnishings, and more.
The only things I didn't DIY were paint and refinishing the hardwoods.  I've done those before, and I know my limitations.
The one major improvement that doesn't show in the pictures is the smell.  The whole placed reeked of dog pee.  I ran an industrial dehumidifier for two weeks, and an ozone machine for another week.  I also used deodorizing floor cleaner, before having the floors sanded and sealed.
Very happy with how this turned out.  It'll be a mid-term rental for traveling nurses, because it's 1/4 mile from a major hospital.
I didn't do a great job tracking my expenses, but total cost was in the $9k-$11k range.","['https://preview.redd.it/d60w1ajdax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7190de62008d97f5518e3a29c8cf4f07695d4576', 'https://preview.redd.it/hn5lcaodax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5d179b4e79824c5615d342bb39ff227603b8754e', 'https://preview.redd.it/no1y6zrdax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5565f894d736c3111265330289f564e9f4eeb849', 'https://preview.redd.it/2ve680vdax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8c7f83d9122c6b67a58dd65a42a19c57a640660b', 'https://preview.redd.it/s9ikj1ydax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d1d43272bb9cb6e82ea1ad7c19208b357c19ffdd', 'https://preview.redd.it/3htyz11eax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9fe39b56646a98caa5242f8f8c58d46103851d17', 'https://preview.redd.it/veam634eax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d9df58aa122fb4b1666349c2433b2f79ed96899e', 'https://preview.redd.it/xfgijs8eax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=85aef9377d71899d7daa3fa76afddb5ad9c5c007', 'https://preview.redd.it/sj9md5deax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=35f9389d9bc7d3ffc0710e3629c8a4c64a1774a8', 'https://preview.redd.it/ozi2btheax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5d6c2add973a7c89a27e5c4373072800f652285b', 'https://preview.redd.it/jw3u1wleax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6e08f1930e6fc917efbacc196fc2eae802b10803', 'https://preview.redd.it/lcvktzoeax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=03a6aeca5f69b53efd2e717fb8ca2c18c9598d42', 'https://preview.redd.it/d6ihavseax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=581f9787e1727540479159ef48c932f842184cfa', 'https://preview.redd.it/5yd7nyveax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=845aa995b777a399958a104c1383b5603427ca18', 'https://preview.redd.it/ji03930fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9d0f2175f273fcb41596346d144db0ce25f12649', 'https://preview.redd.it/ykp44v2fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=16f9864e1839c05b67ba9e13471a7e7334438d4a', 'https://preview.redd.it/81qpr85fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=eaac611616318addd1d5282d090473f4df251ef5', 'https://preview.redd.it/g5pnzf8fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=66f9f8859f4bdc14c0bd7e7a348db0070662960c', 'https://preview.redd.it/2phrkwafax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8a18a878c9a971290977fed18a18f70bd32dc9f0', 'https://preview.redd.it/qr60a6efax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4342102b8c7e0652c372f6231398de8e4b4e8af0']"

DIY,https://old.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1flx4ms/refinished_100_year_old_hardwood_floors_turned/,15042,174,Refinished 100 year old hardwood floors. Turned out better than I hoped.,"Just bought an old house. Pulled up nasty carpet, found some very beat up hardwoods and decided to try my hand at refinishing.
Rented a drum sander and an edge sander first and took off a thick layer of old varnish and spray paint. Started with 36 grit and worked up to 100. Then went back and swapped for a walk-behind orbital sander to smooth the transition between the edges and the center. There were tons of deep scratches from dragging heavy furniture across the floor, as well as deep discoloration, wine stains, you name it. Much of it came out but not all.
Used a variety of cleaners including Bona with some hydrogen peroxide to get most of the stains out. Then did two coats of Minwax oil based poly with some light color, and then about 4 more coats of oil based Varathane poly. After each coat, went over the whole thing first gently shaving off any uneven areas with a paint scraper where the varnish had pooled, then roughing the surface with steel wool and then later 220 grit, before wiping down with tack cloth to remove dust. One mistake was using small foam rollers. They left a lot of tracks that were hard to smooth out, but I bought a bunch of them so stuck it out.
Rental costs were about $200. Materials probably $300-400 for rollers, rags, tack cloth, sandpaper, and 4 cans of poly for about 500 square feet of floor.","['https://preview.redd.it/vlb7tkpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=022a62977f2b43c27d77223290f5c7dc3b80fc47', 'https://preview.redd.it/p3etnkpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2925f9f25bbbc4553ad457e3907cc3f0e03df32d', 'https://preview.redd.it/9fntakpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=dac6802f0de8627438f002a31b6a9d221191d346', 'https://preview.redd.it/8hysakpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=96811788d3971b90e5c13826f046fb9979df5348', 'https://preview.redd.it/schc9mpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fc4a794b04f0f00dbde02c07b04c145301105b57', 'https://preview.redd.it/ca2e7kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1d1c2e729e4746c51971bca465d73ea7e8463e74', 'https://preview.redd.it/p5063kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5bd71f869445dda68f3652dbdfcf54ca4813e27b', 'https://preview.redd.it/4zs17kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4c8d8831286d9404a22ca356b4037990b9870db9', 'https://preview.redd.it/qarvokpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=604b4e924b05b8e5a09986b43a8cc798ed36f2a3', 'https://preview.redd.it/hrxw4kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5600ee1dedbc936b5723fb99babb2ff7a856fff9', 'https://preview.redd.it/omrnskpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9b81ceda58e768292419c5b4faa860e4828ec34e', 'https://preview.redd.it/1rvrvjqf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=120b62febb3831884e3c655ebcd8db96bfe5b93b', 'https://preview.redd.it/pyonwlpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=109ed8a80aaf60c831402e59da757e4d992e4fe3']"
