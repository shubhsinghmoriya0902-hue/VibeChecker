I did everything I could and way more than I ever should have to solve this without being petty. Even offered to pay for her wall mount seeing how she’s essentially unemployed.
Y’all, all it took was a quick, no bs email to my property management about my neighbor blocking the hall w personal items and violating fire code. They responded within minutes.
Now this morning as I go to do laundry I see the hallway totally clear.
I’m about to shed a tear. OH AND YES. I sent the neighbor a link to my previous post in this thread which got sooo much attention. No response lmao.
I’m gonna take everyone’s solid advice and not be a fkn pushover next time. Should this bike ever reappear… I’m gonna move it myself.

So I moved last month, new apt in Brooklyn. Love the space, the neighborhood, decent rent. Three cats.
A small downside: the common hall/stairwell is suuuper narrow (3ft maybe).
My roommate and downstairs neighbor keep bikes locked to the handrail, taking up >50% of the width of the hallway. Spoke w my roommate and put polite sticky notes on the neighbor’s door, asking for a bike free hall.
My roommate obliged immediately!!
My neighbor however… has been texting me over the last 2 weeks essentially refusing to do a thing. Tons of pity-me energy and passive aggressiveness. - “Sorry this is a slight inconvenience for you, hmmm 🤔”
They won’t:
- store bike on the bottom floor where there is more room
- store bike outside with a lock (fear of theft)
- put the bike in their apartment (no space)
- buy a wall mount (no money)
- let me spot them $ for the mount (not comfortable)
I’m a large guy. Every day I scoot past this bike and if I have groceries/packages/coats then there’s no getting around it; we have to bang the bike up as we scoot on by.
I get it — bike storage is tricky. But it’s not on me to figure out. The bike is obtrusive and 100% violates fire code.
I emailed property management about it today, two weeks after the post it’s. Now the neighbor is calling me a Karen when all I want is to walk to my place without banging past her damn bike like 4x a day lol.
I’ve contacted property management — we’ll see if that goes anywhere.

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mhkgoo/new_roommate_wants_the_4_br_to_herself/,21004,1778,New roommate wants the 4 br to herself.,"Just moved into a new place. She would rather have it to herself
I (22F) just moved into a 4 br apartment in Brooklyn. I found this place on June homes and I am here for a little over 3 months.
Upon my arrival to this apartment, my roommate, S (27F), looked absolutely shocked to see me walk in. I politely tell her that I am one of her new roommates.
“Oh did they not tell you? They give me the option to approve or deny roommates and I sent them an email saying I didn’t want to live with you.”
Ok, strange first interaction with someone. I then told her that they had already taken my money and therefore I will be living here. All is ok and I don’t see her until the following day.
I was moving the rest of my stuff in and we were discussing our habits. She likes to have her own things and I told her that was absolutely fine. I had my own plates and cookware as I have a food allergy. I then go to throw something away and she tells me that I cannot use her kitchen garbage can. I explain to her that I would not mind taking the trash out if it meant that I didn’t have to go out and purchase another garbage can. She agrees.
Mind you, her belongings take up the majority of our shared living space (empty boxes, bins, and clothing). It is to the point where it is blocking the bedroom door of another tenant. S also has 2 cats— I believe they are registered ESA animals but I am unsure if both of them are. They have been in her room the entire time since I moved in (poor cats).
Fast forward to yesterday. I am getting ready to leave for a friends birthday party and I need to shower and use the bathroom. I check at 8:30 and the shower is on. I then go and do my thing for about an hour and the shower is still on at 9:30. I knock on the door and S opens it. She is not showering but has the tub faucet on for some reason. Eventually she leaves and I am able to do my thing. But S had been using the bathroom for well over an hour, which rubbed me the wrong way.
Fast forward to this morning. I was coming in from staying the night at my friends and I see my dishes on the counter. I assumed that she had ran the dishwasher while I was out and has left it out for me to put away.
This was not the case. She went out of her way to empty everything that was not hers from the dishwasher and just washed her own dishes. She comes out of her room. And my dirty dishes had just been sitting on the counter overnight.
“Did you take my things out of the dishwasher?”
“Oh yes sorry I can empty my stuff out now”
In this moment i then meet the person who is in the room next to me, N (~28M), and we discuss how she has been acting. Apparently when he had toured the place S was out there trying to convince him not to move in. The person giving the tour says that S does this frequently, and it seems as though she wants this 4 bedroom apartment to herself. Again, very weird and a bit antagonistic.
30 minutes go by and I see a note on the trash can.
“I know I told you I was comfortable with you using my trash can but now I am not. Can you please buy yourself a new one.”
This really set me off. She comes out and I ask her if she can move some of her belongings out of the shared space to make room for another trashcan.
“I don’t have any space in my room”
Not my problem I fear. I then explain to her that it is very weird to take someone’s dirty dishes out of the dishwasher without saying anything. And I questioned why she can only wash her things and not anyone else’s. I tell her that we can use the dishwasher pods I bought.
“I can’t use that dish detergent it would ruin my plates”
I just tell her that she needs to get rid of a few boxes so that there is space for others to have their belongings and we leave it at that. I purchase a new garbage can and bags and bring it inside. N is now in the shared space and says to S:
“Would you be able to move your trashcan? If none of us are allowed to use it I don’t think it should be in the shared space”
“I’m sorry I don’t have any space in my room”
N goes on to tell her that it doesn’t make sense to have that out in the common area when nobody else can go near it. He ate with that I completely agree.
And now I’m here trying to figure out what to do. I feel as though she acts this way to try to get people to move out.
I plan on documenting everything and keeping it handy should this get further escalated. But otherwise I’m unsure if there’s anything I can do. Any advice would be appreciated.","['https://preview.redd.it/zixwa4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2f7402bf7eae37d8e20e231612d214fefda91239', 'https://preview.redd.it/7bzro4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=66d193ddd32b417aadb1951fed54b6f06745bdec', 'https://preview.redd.it/jwjkc4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e94e6219340c9b1b5141055c9f3298dc1b9d13b9', 'https://preview.redd.it/9r7684gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9ed061fe5a1bcf6876df615f7f90ce1d66e53b58', 'https://preview.redd.it/zbxta4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0423a38c890d9295de5077573b58e35983d631f7']"

I live in a really small apartment—basically a rooming house since there’s no living room and the walls are paper thin. We hear everything, especially through the vents. I’ve been here for 8 months and it was mostly fine before, mainly because my old roommate (technically my subletter) was also kind of the landlord and worked early shifts, so everyone kept it quiet after 11pm out of respect.
But ever since he moved out, things have gone downhill fast.
My current roommate is an alcoholic and stays up every single night until 3am drinking, slamming doors, cooking, watching movies at full blast, gaming, and having loud phone convos. I used to stay up late until 1-2am so I let it slide, but things changed recently after some health news.
I got bloodwork done and my doctor warned me I’m at risk for metabolic syndrome. Type 2 diabetes runs in my family and I am 30 pounds overweight. He told me I need to watch my diet and start working out to avoid the health issues in the future. I’ve committed to waking up at 6am for fitness classes and completely changing my lifestyle—better diet and consistent workouts. I even told both of my roommates this. Gave them a heads up that I’ll be waking up early every day.
But this girl has been LOUD every single night. Midnight, 1am, 2am—doesn’t matter. I’ve been surviving on 4–5 hours of sleep and I’m honestly hitting a breaking point. I’ve texted her politely, reminded her in person, even threatened to blast music in the mornings. I’ve had to go into her room at night and ask her to shut up. Nothing works.
Tonight I finally thought I’d get some sleep—she wasn’t home, and I passed out early around 11pm. Then 1:30am hits and I wake up to her coming home with FOUR people, drinking, laughing, playing music. Her room is right beside mine. I banged on her wall, got no response, so I texted her. She half-heartedly told her friends to quiet down but the music kept going.
Then I overhear her talking sh*t about me insinuating I’m “playing the victim” and that my cat wakes her up in the morning??? My cat maybe meowed five times total in 8 months—and never before 9 am and that’s being generous.
So yeah, I lost it. I stormed into her room and yelled. Told her she was being completely disrespectful and that this is now three nights in a row. And she has the nerve to mock me for my weight loss immediately and says, “Have fun with your weight loss” in a sarcastic tone. Her friends had to hold her back because she got in my face. I literally had to threaten to call the cops.
I’m seriously starting to believe she’s doing this on purpose. Like… how else do you explain it? I’ve told her I wake up at 6am every day now. Why the hell would you invite a group over to drink and party directly beside someone’s room at 1:30am?

She never spoke to any of us about it. I can empathize with someone who needs a place to stay but it felt very inconsiderate for her to not even mention at all.
My main issue is that between the two of them they probably own 50+ pairs of shoes. Our very narrow hallway is becoming an extension of their bedroom and every pair of shoes you see belongs to the two of them. The black dresser is full of shoes. The wall cubby too.
I want to tell them to find space in their room or get rid of shoes. My bedroom door opens right up to their black dresser and their shoes are on both sides of my door now.

I wasn’t sure if I wanted to invade her privacy by calling but employee walked me through on how and what to say, and ensured me there was no way the company she worked for were having issues.
Upon calling her job the only response I got was “I’m sorry I think you have the wrong establishment we’re not having a payroll issue” I called a mutual friend who knows us both very well turns out roommate wasn’t at work last week…
I’m upset that she would even continue to lie but at least I got to the bottom of it. Tomorrow I’m going to go down to our leasing office to talk options. I most likely will never have a roommate again. Super sad. But eventually this will be something I look back on and just say “another thing that has shaped me into who I become”

i have just finished my second year at university and have been living in the same house in student accommodation the whole time. the student accommodation isn’t dorms, but a gated community of town houses that is a 5 minute walk from campus. each house has 5 rooms, 1 downstairs that is a ‘premium’ room as it is bigger (the room that i live in), and 4 upstairs rooms. each room has their own bathroom, but the kitchen, dining area and living area are all shared by the housemates. additionally, we all only pay rent for our own rooms so as people come and go from the university, we don’t have to deal with replacing roommates, etc., and management of the “village” is responsible for putting in new housemates and dealing with individual contracts.
here’s where it all goes wrong. at this point i’ve lived in my room in my house for 1.5 years and never had any issues with housemates (ive had upwards of 8 from all sorts of backgrounds and things were fine). the place is pretty chill, and everyone who lives there HAS to be a student at the university and is usually around 18-25 years old. semester 2 of university starts (around june as i live in australia) and there are 3 vacant rooms upstairs so im expecting some new housemates. as i come home one day, i see two middle aged ladies sitting at the dining table, so as i walk in the door i introduce myself and say that i live here and  ask who they are, and to my shock they say they are my new housemates. they explain that they are masters students who are both 40 years old and have just moved to australia from Korea together (one of them has a husband and 2 kids that she has left back home!!).
at first things are ok, but at around the second week of us living together things get strange. they message the house group chat complaining about a mess in the dining room that needed cleaning (which was just my jacket left on one of the chairs as i had forgotten to put it in my bag on my way to class). they said that they couldn’t eat lunch at the table because it was there, which i thought was strange (why couldn’t they just move it?) but i said sorry anyways and put it back in my room. things like this continue to happen until it starts to really frustrate me and my friend (who lives in one of the upstairs rooms).
the ladies then come up with their own rules for the house without consulting the rest of the housemates (who are all ages 19-21), and post them on the group chat. these include a DAILY vacuuming schedule, disinfecting the microwave after every use, forbidding the use or opening of the sliding doors to the house, keeping the curtains shut at all times during the day, we cannot make any noise (even playing music on our phones on half volume in our own rooms) and insisting that when they are using the kitchen or common areas, we cannot be in the kitchen or common areas either. me and my friend who lives upstairs decided to talk to them about these ‘rules’ because we both have lived in the house for 1.5 years and these ladies have lived here for 2 weeks, and we think that they are a bit unfair, ESPECIALLY as it is a very social place as it is university accommodation that is kind of made to accommodate younger students looking to make friends and enjoy the university culture/environment.
we talked to them super nicely and said that we want to make sure that they are comfortable in this house, and that we are willing to make adjustments if they are too so that everybody can be happy. instead of being polite, they essentially told us that they think because they are masters students and older than us, that they get to make the rules and we have to listen. i pointed out nicely pointed out after this that at the end of the day, we pay the same rent (i pay more as i have the downstairs room, but i didn’t say that) and that in this house we are equals and should all treat each other with respect despite any age differences.
After this, things got pretty tense pretty quickly and they became nasty. They would yell at us whenever we came downstairs, complain about tiny things, and ultimately write emails to management about us saying untrue things, and making it out to sound like we are hoarders and slobs who are forcing them to live in squalor. none of this i would like to point out is true, our house is usually pretty clean but of course there is just a bit of general mess that is created by existing as a human beings in the house, that we clean up at the end of the day after university if we haven’t already cleaned immediately after we made any mess (dishes, a few crumbs on the carpet, etc.). Also, our house gets monthly inspections to check for cleanliness and we have never failed.
naturally, admin takes their complaints pretty seriously and now we have been told off (even though the two ladies have attached no photographical evidence of the “mess”) and our house now has WEEKLY inspections.  additionally, we are now only allowed guests once at a time, for one hour at a time with their permission, even if we are just in our own rooms not making noise. admin doesn’t take us seriously when we try to tell them about the situation because we are half their age, and obviously they are going to believe the 40 year olds rather than the 20 year olds.
Anyways, I asked admin to make them attach photos of the “mess” they were complaining about every few days and to my surprise i received a call from admin shorty afterwards. in the phone call they said, we have received another complain from your housemates but after looking at the photos, we completely agree that “they are making mountains out of mole hills” and that they too are “sick of dealing with their complaints.”
another side note, i have a pretty severe anxiety disorder and having to deal with this whole situation for the last 6 months has been awful for my mental health. i haven’t been able to leave my room when they are out in the common spaces and even have panic attacks when using the kitchen for fear of them coming back and yelling at me. because of this i’ve been planning on moving out of the house, but family/financial situations haven’t allowed that. it’s holidays right now so im staying with my parents, but when semester starts up again in february i truly don’t know what im going to do to deal with them, the disrespect and endless complaints…
ALSO my friend from upstairs has now moved out because of them and the lack of support from admin, so im on my own. hopefully the new housemate who fills that room will be nice.
another note, in my opinion they are WAY too old to be living in student housing, and i just want to know what they expected when moving in with three 20yos?! and its not like there isn’t other cheap accommodation around. they moved together from korea, so why don’t they just move into their own apartment together if they have such a specific way for how they want to live?!?! also its not like they don’t know about the other housing options, because one day they showed me cheap apartments in the area that they suggested i move into because they didn’t want to live with me anymore….
what do you guys think? am i in the wrong here?!","['https://preview.redd.it/eh2m687a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=88eaec78fb5a0468527f971fec9c2e02800ed1b0', 'https://preview.redd.it/wdrwas4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1dc36b6ca0eb7a07b7330e4214f740c9478717a3', 'https://preview.redd.it/s7x8a87a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b62dc6c8123c3eaedba5db230e226d114b314290', 'https://preview.redd.it/jsp9vm9a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=02ac8684e34e644dc89aabfa1f3707a0971fbe46', 'https://preview.redd.it/jmqkxr4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=97ae14d2387a7210e798189c5303d2076c901f5e', 'https://preview.redd.it/zar5zr4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a95506b2a2c4314c2a1f8c90a1eae07fc3a71091', 'https://preview.redd.it/oc3ihr4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9156c741883f5bda727c629115c32d08440c86c6', 'https://preview.redd.it/frea8t4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=03fa8b92706ccb4bc01e6b7fc553adeed6a28cde', 'https://preview.redd.it/bnn6us4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7d6f50db12a1396be2fc6c2eed13c156b75bc675', 'https://preview.redd.it/5gmz3t4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b4710bdf25e93dfe46c6a1b15767c7ae7bf21ed5', 'https://preview.redd.it/x4dm497a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=21ad9652d44f6cbab0a4e726de1957ecf6be2817', 'https://preview.redd.it/figolt4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7d039362ff0ee5f75aaa75c00db5e7c5e9cafc18', 'https://preview.redd.it/oxi7gu4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f5eeed84ad25da9ba025237d9dcd1053602b22cd', 'https://preview.redd.it/q7lxxt4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7485532599935d5d602bd6d86375a3e8e2d18a58', 'https://preview.redd.it/7qfhk77a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=27b7dc15c0bb928cff0a82ef08a74154c9bb7584', 'https://preview.redd.it/9yc0i87a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=82ef3aa007bac87ea33b67fa4823876efd889085', 'https://preview.redd.it/xbr5cv4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2af2e08a5b8fe7f3b8eb41be1fc815bbea93a28e', 'https://preview.redd.it/j82s7v4a0z7e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=38265112fd8779bc196d396b769d2e1ecaa05b5a']"

Is livid I’m demanding he pay rent or move in. Two days later he brings a friend over to antagonize me.,"At this point I might just be looking to vent because she's choosing to not understand. I'll take advice though!
My roommate is 27 and her boyfriend is 30ish. She met her boyfriend shortly after we moved in and slowly but surely he was here every night and no longer had an apartment. Found this all out in over heard phone calls etc.
Didn't care much at first because he would help take care of her dog that was pissing all over the house but after a year I asked for him to pitch in. I was told he doesn't have any money and that she would talk to him.
A couple months later we get a lease renewal and she lets me know they are getting an apartment together. Which... if you can afford to move into an apartment together you can pay your fair share here. I asked for him to contribute for the last 3 months of our lease and then found out he has been paying rent. Just only to her.
For reference - we live in a luxury high rise in downtown Chicago with full amenities. This idea that he only uses her space is fucking nuts. They are fucking and fighting ALL over the house. For a while he was stealing my weed daily and even had the nerve to wake me up at 3am to give him weed. they use the common areas more than I do.
How are people this unaware?!?
Two nights after we exchange these texts my roommates boyfriend and friend come into the apartment while my roommate isn’t home and goes straight to my room, sees I’m there, then says ‘oh shit’ and closes the door. So for reference it’s 2 am and I wake up to two grown men in my room. They proceed to play music loudly and yell at me to ‘call the cops if I care. I have a sliding bedroom door that doesn’t lock or cancel out any living room noise.
I have a meeting with management on Monday to explain the situation. I laid some ground rules down I’m sure they won’t follow and ya.

The next day I received another aggressive text from her where she was upset because I moved her FINISHED laundry on top of the dryer after it had been sitting there over night once again so I could dry my sheets. She didn’t even notice I’d done this till a whole day later, and honestly I think this is pretty standard practice for a communal washing machine shared between 3 people.

You need to understand that recently about 15 months ago I suffered a head injury and am in the process of receiving disability. I lived off of my savings for the past 15 months which are dwindling as I wait for assistance from the government. I served in the Navy and unfortunately the military takes forever to help when it comes to stuff like this. I don't have the option to just move out of where I live because I live in Massachusetts which is so expensive where my rent is way below the average  and I need to be around here because my mom is 84 years old and I do my best to help her as well. So I am dumbfounded that once again less than maybe 10 days later there's poop skid marks in the shower again. I just want to share with you guys what's going on because it's sort of like therapy to me to be able to see all your comments and get a little cuckle out of this crappy situation.

It was very helpful. To those who were looking for more of a
r/maliciouscompliance
response from me, I believe you will be disappointed. I just don’t think that would be the smartest way for me to handle things, and would quite frankly be a little immature this early on into my stay here.
Secondly, I would like to explain a few things:
     1. S has been living in this apartment for well over a year.
     2. Our rental company works like student housing. All four of us have separate leases’ and we each pay for our own room and use of the shared space. You can rent a room for as little as one month, but up to 2 years.
     3. When a tenant is already living in the apartment they get an email showing them the profile of a potential new tenant. You can sign a form that is a “Notice of Decline” if you do not want to live with the replacement tenant. S tried to sign that for all 3 of us who have moved in. And I assume has done it to most people who have tried to live in the apartment with her.
I am pretty convinced S has some form of contamination OCD— which explains (but does not excuse) a lot of her weird behavior when it comes to separate trash cans, long showers, and not wanting to have other peoples dishes in the dishwasher with her things. Obviously, this is not really something I can bring up with her directly as that would be completely inappropriate, but it seems likely this is the case.
Last night, S moved the boxes that were blocking the doorway of the other tenant (before and after pictured above). I have now met that tenant, P, and he is not as concerned with this situation as he will only be living with us for a month. I am glad that she moved the boxes, however, they are now on another table in the shared living space. While it is now no longer a hazard related to the egress of P’s doorway, it still violates the lease terms because our shared space is still being used as her personal storage unit.
This morning, we had a cleaning lady come in who the rental company hires when new tenants move in. That was all fine until I heard S laughing with the cleaning lady and I stepped outside into the common area to see what was going on. As soon as I walk out, S asks the cleaning lady if they can talk about something outside lol. I would only assume she was complaining about us.
As for the report I made to our rental company, I have yet to hear back. Supposedly they will be calling S today and telling her to remove her belongings from the living room and if nothing changes in a few days, they will further escalate it.
N has now also made a report that also documents the antagonistic behavior S displayed when he was taking a tour of the apartment alongside the issue of her belongings. He has not heard anything back yet.
Overall, while I can empathize with the potential of her struggling with contamination OCD, her behavior towards us has been extremely rude and uncalled for. I’m hoping that pressure from the rental company can force her into getting a storage unit or throwing away some of the empty boxes in the living room. I don’t know if there’s really much else the rental company can do in regards to her behavior towards new tenants, but we’ll see.
Again, if anything else happens in the next day I will keep you all posted!","['https://preview.redd.it/hfkycuvi98hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6a5cce2717e3facd04e125cc8b7483d665de780c', 'https://preview.redd.it/1kyquuvi98hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d9704192e1804f9cd8de6c1520dbc8a1901a95da', 'https://preview.redd.it/utv47wvi98hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=887e407961da86003cc66dc80ff2a98468ca3e28']"

First, thank you all for the support—it really meant a lot. I’m happy to say I finally moved out (thank God!) and I’m in a much better place now with a sweet roommate my age. I feel so much safer and truly blessed.
Unfortunately, things did not improve after my last post. He randomly called me the ER word (I’m Black), banged on my door aggressively, and cursed me out just because I told him to stop going into my private bathroom. He ate my food, would shut off the breaker to my room whenever I adjusted the AC (making it unbearably hot), and did little things just to get under my skin. I kept telling myself to stay calm and just hold out until I could leave.
When I told him my move-out date, I couldn’t finish everything in one trip since I was moving alone. I left two bags of clothes outside my door to grab later. He then emailed me (we only communicated through email) saying he hired a “cleaner” and that the bags were trash, so he’d throw them out. I told him to leave them alone, came back, put my stuff in my room, locked it, and left again.
The next day, I returned to find a chair wedged against my door to block me. When I finally got inside, I saw he tried to break into my room using a knife and multiple tools which is in the picture.  They were all stuck so deep he couldn’t pull it out, even with pliers. He tried to laugh it off and make jokes, but I just stared blankly, not giving him a reaction. Internally I was in disbelief, but I refused to show it.
I reported everything to the property manager, but she didn’t care at all. Throughout this whole ordeal, she never helped me—if anything, she fueled the situation. They’re clearly close. After I privately messaged her saying I planned to leave a negative review, he texted me 30 minutes later telling me to “think twice” before posting it.
When I called the manager, I asked why she shared a private conversation with him—especially knowing the danger I was in. Even when I sent her a photo of the door damage, her response was, “I’ll call him and tell him to let you move out.” Like… seriously? No sense of safety awareness. She still hasn’t given me any higher contact info despite me following up multiple times.
After a furious call, I haven’t heard from him since, which probably means she told him to back off. But yeah—this was a nightmare. I didn’t enjoy this “ride,” but I definitely learned from it and I will be building up my review (also does anyone have suggestions on sites I can report this building on, I want to do everything in my power to make sure this is seen by upper management everything I’ve had to deal with the PM who damn near encouraged everything instead of doing her job)
Again, I’m safe now. Everyone was truly surprised I made it out alive and me too honestly, i was always on my toes and made sure to always be aware in that apartment, honestly think it slightly traumatized me in a way but I don’t want this situation to affect me mentally. Other than that, my new roommate is kind and respectful, and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted.

For the first year we lived together, I did all the cooking, cleaning, and household management. Every single bit of it. I finally got burned out and about 5 months ago, I completely stopped. I only clean up after myself.
As you can guess, the common areas have become a disaster.
They've started leaving passive-aggressive notes telling me to clean specific messes they made. In the past, I usually just did it to avoid conflict. But I'm done.
The latest note, left on the fridge next to a mess they made, just says: ""Please clean.""
The ""please"" is new. It feels like a manipulation tactic because their previous, ruder notes stopped working on me.
I did not clean it. I am leaving it there. I am preparing for the argument that is definitely coming.
How would you handle this? How do I finally get it through to them that I am not their housekeeper and we need a fair system?

Second Edit:
Hi everyone, OP here.
I just wanted to say a massive THANK YOU to every single person who commented, upvoted, and shared their stories and advice. I was feeling completely defeated and your support and tough love gave me the push I needed to finally speak up. I read every comment, and I'm so grateful for this community.
Here's what happened:
I took the collective advice and finally talked to my roommates. It was direct, but I stayed calm and used a lot of the scripts you all provided.
The immediate result: They actually listened. They cleaned up the mess from the note today, and we've agreed to sit down next week on our mutual day off to create a formal chore schedule and system.
This is a huge first step. I know it's just the beginning and the real test will be if they stick to it, but it's progress I didn't have before I posted here.
Your messages did more than just give me advice; they made me feel justified and far less alone in this. From the people who told me to stop being a doormat to those who shared their own identical stories it all helped more than you know.
I'll try to update again after we have our meeting and see if the new system holds. Thanks again, everyone. You guys are the best.
🚨Final Update:
We talked and reached an agreement! I'll handle cooking, they cover groceries, and we're splitting chores (dishes, garbage, common areas). Thanks so much to everyone for the advice and support ;it really helped me advocate for a fair solution. 🙌",

Both of the dogs have a terrible flea infestation and we asked him to correct it before he decided to move in but he has yet to do so. This also includes never bathing them and I’m pretty sure they’ve never been walked a day in there life.

(Everyone in this story is in college btw)
Recently during my spring break my girlfriend started to act really weirdly toward me, and it seemed like she almost didn’t want to talk with me. Well after 3 years of being with her, I told her that I could tell something was off and we needed to talk about it. So eventually we met up and I confronted her about avoiding me and hiding things. That is where she admitted to having spent all of that time with my roommate. I considered him to be one of my best friends at this point, and I really didn’t want to believe what was being told to me. I asked her if she had developed a romantic interest for him, and she told me that she had. The worst part of it all though? He had admitted his feelings for her as well, and they were hanging out even after the point. I asked her if she would stop talking to him if we continued to date, and she said no. So now not only did I break up with my girlfriend of 3 years, I have to continue to live with this guy for the rest of this year. We also signed a lease together for next year, but I’m in the process of figuring out how to get out of that currently. I would rather cut those people out of my life than continue to hangout with them, but being in this situation showed me how much I truly got a bad roommate. It just has all felt like a dark humor rom com at this point.
Edit: I really do appreciate all of the support that I have received from people. I just happened to stumble across this subreddit and decided to share what my roommate had done to me, and I never expected for there to be this much attention to it. I will post an update once I figure things out. Thanks again!

Let’s start with this weekend, shall we. I stopped by my storage unit to grab a few things. One of those things being my PC. Im starting a remote position and need it for work. There’s simply no room for me to bring my desk so I decide that I will be moving one of her boxes to make room for my monitor, keyboard, and mouse. And I did just that! Pictured above you can see my disgusting setup lol. I was able to get my work done yesterday night and all was well.
Later that night I am out in the common room and S approaches me.
“Would you be able to move your computer? I use those bins for cooking”
“I would but there is literally no room for me to fit a desk in here.”
“Do you want me to move my things?”
I simply do not understand how someone has this much and insists that they need and use all of it. I moved my things. She pushed her table all of 6 inches. Some of you might say that I should have kept it there and stood my ground. I get that and my plan is to just move the box when I need it and put it back when I’m done working. Because I found out something this morning that has truly set me off.
Today, N and I received another update from the rental company. You can read what they wrote us in the second image. How I chose to read it was:
“We know S has been breaking the lease and has been antagonistic towards you guys, but she’s moving out in 2 weeks so we actually solved the problem :)”
Actually no. No problem was resolved, in fact it was made worse. This enraged me more than anything S has ever done. June homes basically told us to go fuck ourselves and pay the full price of the rent. Lol not on my watch. Immediately upon receiving this message I call their support line and I am connected with a man who can essentially guarantee nothing.
I explained to him that I don’t understand how they are expecting me to just let this slide when she is literally breaking the lease by having her things in the room. I will not be paying full price when I cannot use a large part of the space I am paying for. I Karen-ed out on him. He said that I likely will not get any sort of refund whatsoever. I am going to absolutely make sure that is not the case.
After calling I looked to see if they had physical offices in manhattan, as I was in the area for a job interview. I walked to two address that were listed for them and it seemed that neither were correct.
Quite frankly, it is a slap in the face to just let this slide without any sort of compensation. She is literally breaking a contract. I wonder if I can escalate this legally, because I am unsure if they will listen to me. I included a couple of screenshots of the lease that I think would be helpful in my case. Let me know if there are things that I should be looking for in the lease that would give me a better case!
At this point it is beyond S and I am just now so annoyed with June Homes. The man on the phone said they would resolve this later today but we will see.","['https://preview.redd.it/9hf336ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a6ca5bf5dccdc04e1b397127d6161b9ef45091e0', 'https://preview.redd.it/lpc5d6ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=829a4e17b5c3a6b95642bc88ba6eb49b9cd4665a', 'https://preview.redd.it/mgbcs5ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ca72c1a12b5c286bfeabb8de6ddce10cd30f1950', 'https://preview.redd.it/al3kd6ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=39333d421479133963292fb8c75d6ead9db68b77']"

she has someone over every. single. day. just all these people coming and going all the time. she’s 18, so all her friends are literal children and they all come over to get drunk and eat our food and watch tv outside of my room. does she clean up after any of these people? of course not. recently she had like 6 different people over with 24 hrs and one of them stole a bag from a girl at the gym. she left, and the owner of the bag tracked her airpods to our house. the upstairs neighbours got involved too and were very upset. B and her friends all swore up and down they didn’t have her bag but the airpod tracker showed that they were obviously here. the police were called and her and her friends left and i had to deal with the policewoman and let her search the house and answer all these questions. it was terrible and really embarrassing. we know the airpods are still in the house to this day because the girl could connect her phone to them in the house but the police gave up looking.
she has vacuumed and mopped only once since living here. and she didn’t even mop properly, i had to redo it because the floor looked worse than how it was before. not once cleaned the fridge, counters, stovetop, microwave, or bathroom. and she makes these areas very messy. i try to wait until she does it herself but ive learned it’ll never happen and i eventually can’t stand it anymore and clean it myself. she also doesn’t do her dishes, her bf does them (and doesn’t clean them properly). and when i ask her to do them she’ll only do a few and then leave the rest. and they’re not even clean there’s still food on them… or she just keeps dishes in her room until there’s mold growing on them.
her bf basically lived here for 2 and a half months. i could seriously count the amount of times he WASNT here on one hand. he didn’t pay rent, ate our food but didn’t contribute to groceries, showered here every other day. turns out he had been assaulting my roommate in her sleep this whole time and she broke up with him. they would have really loud messy fights and would choke her in front of me all the time. it was like a sex thing for them and even she said not to do it in front of me when i expressed it made me uncomfortable and he kept doing it. his friends also maced her with bear spray for talking bad about him. i found out they got back together when i saw her sneak him out of her window and walk around the house. i had also seen someone get out of the shower with her the previous night but assumed it was this other guy she was seeing. so that means her abusive and violent ex stayed the night without any of us knowing, even after we and our other roommate clearly expressed that we never wanted him at the house ever again.
today was my fucking breaking point. my other roommate heard them having sex and when we asked if he was here she said he was staying over because she felt bad that he was having problems at his house. i am like actually livid. now she absolutely hates me for daring to be upset at her behaviour. me and my other roommate are writing an email to our property manager tomorrow to try to get her out soon. she has said previously that she’ll move out because she knows she’s not a good roommate but i’m like a year… which is our whole lease?

My roommate (30s m) and I (26f) are both white, I have coprelalia which is the rude version of tourettes. My roommate thinks the N word is just the most hilarious thing ever, he thinks it's even funnier to trigger my disability in a way that forces me to say a racial slur that I don't want to say. I have repeatedly told him that 1, I don't want to say the N word regardless of if it's voluntary or not and 2, the more I tic the N word the more often it will happen randomly and the more difficult it is to supress it in public. I cannot seem to explain to him that ticcing the N word in public can actually put me in serious danger, not everyone wants to hear ""I have tourettes"" after I tic something offensive, especially when it comes to racial slurs
Idk what to do at this point other than just avoid him and move out when the lease ends
Edit: holy shit this blew up. I'm going to try and clear up some misconceptions I'm seeing in the comments.
I've seen a lot of people accusing me of being racist for having an N word tic. Coprolalia takes what I subconciously perceive as socially inappropriate and forces me to say it. It doesn't make me say what I'm thinking, it doesn't make me say what I want to say, it usually makes me say things I really really do not want to say. I've never voluntarily said the N word, I also never said ""Bob Doll"" before it became one of my most common tics and yet it happens frequently. There is a tremendous amount of documentation on coprolalia, if you don't believe me I encourage you to educate yourselves on the condition before berating me for something you don't understand
Some people are asking how it's possible for someone else to trigger a tic. Tics can be triggered by any number of things. Stress is probably the biggest one, if I'm anxious about ticcing something specific it makes it far more likely to tic that specific thing. Quoting tics is nearly a guarantee to get me to tic whatever you're quoting, if someone says ""Bob Doll"" or even just ""Bob"" I'm going to tic ""Bob Doll"". My roommate is saying the N word to trigger that specific tic. I have a few other random triggers, extended eye contact makes me tic ""c*nt"", fist bumps cause ""fuck you"" and just seeing a very tall woman I know causes me to tic ""big woman, biiig""
A few people have dug into my profile, they saw that I've made posts about being autistic and having dyslexia. According to these people I must be fake because apparently you can't be autistic, have dyslexia and tourettes all at once. Tourettes, autism, dyslexia and ADHD (I also have that) all have very high comorbitiy rates. It's extremely common for people with autism to have ADHD and nearly every single person I've ever met with ADHD has dyslexia. Tourettes is less common but still has a high comorbitiy rate with both ADHD and autism.

There's a lot of people who think this is funny. I find that absolutely fucking appaling for a number of reasons. First off, anyone with a maturity level beyond a middle schooler can understand that a white person saying a racial slur is not funny. Additionally, you have no idea how humiliating it is for someone to play with your disability as a way to amuse themselves, it's fucking awful. I can't imagine the people who do think it's funny have enough empathy to even hear what I'm saying but Jesus Christ what the fuck. You're laughing at something that genuinely puts my life and career at risk
My roommate is a POS, I'm not able to move yet but hopefully in 4 months I will be leaving with my partner and one of the roommates I actually like. I don't want to escalate anything, I only see him a few times a week and some of the suggestions people have made (ear defenders, ignoring him) should do the trick just fine until I can move and never speak to him again
The negative comments have really been getting to me, I probably just shouldn't be interacting with them but it really sucks seeing people with absolutely no understanding of tourettes judge me for my disability. For the most part comments have been really kind and supportive, I really appreciate all the nice people here. My situation is pretty awful but I'll be ok till I'm able to move. Thanks to everyone who's been nice and especially thank you to those who are clearing up misconceptions about tourettes for me. Y'all are awesome",

NOPE.
Monday night, I’m asleep by 11 because I have in-office work on Tuesdays. At 2:30 AM, I wake up to a huge group of people coming in. Music starts blasting. It’s a full-blown afterparty in our living room—on a Monday.
The house is over 100 years old and the walls are paper thin. I text Good Roommate (Roommate 2), but she doesn’t reply because she left her phone upstairs to check things out. Bad Roommate even directs drunk strangers to use Good Roommate and I's shared bathroom (which backs against my bedroom wall), so now I’m hearing people slamming the door, laughing, and stumbling all night. (Would like to mention Bad Roommate has her own private bathroom upstairs on our 3rd floor that is perfectly usable)

ight broke out between random bar guys and Bad Roommate’s boyfriend’s friends. Just straight-up bar fight in my kitchen. I tell Good Roommate someone threw up outside. Good Roommate (bless her) casually asks Bad Roommate if anyone puked. Bad Roommate, instead of helping, asks the drunk guys
if they puked
(lol). They say no (duh), so she accuses
me
of being
paranoid and eavesdropping
.
Bad Roommate then goes to bed, leaving Good Roommate to kick out these drunk strangers until 7:30 AM.
Later that day — after crashing at work and faking a reason to go home early — I finally get a response to my message from
5 days prior
where I had asked to talk and ""apologize"".
Here’s what she sent me:
“You can and should apologize though and without therapy terms if possible, I’m listening. Also, I’m having people over Friday and would appreciate if you could get lost then ❤️”
See attached screenshot [pic below].
That was it. I’m done. Three days later, I signed a lease for my own one-bedroom. I move in Saturday. I have no idea why she insisted both Good Roommate & I not sign the lease for this current space, but I am so thankful for her stupidity. She doesn’t know yet, Good Roommate told me privately that she's skipping out early in June.
I’m out. I’m free. Reap what you sow. And no longer living with someone who thinks “get lost” is a cute way to communicate.

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mra1ds/my_roommate_is_genuinely_insane_and_is_now/,5786,2209,my roommate is genuinely insane and is now destroying my belongings,"i (20) moved in about 10 months ago, and at the beginning my roommate (45) was extremely nice - i thought i had won the lottery. she had explained when i moved in that she has celiac disease, so shes allergic to wheat and soy, and showed me which silverware and dishes were communal and which were specifically hers. i told her no worries, and tried to be as mindful when cooking/cleaning in the kitchen as i can.
i got an ebike a little after moving in, so i could get to and from work without sinking money into uber. because i couldnt afford a car. i came home one day and she had, of her own accord, cleared a spot in the living room for me to put it, since before i was just trying to park it as out of the way as i can. i thanked her and apologized that its pretty intrusive, saying i would keep it outside but im scared of it being stolen especially since our neighborhood is student housing. along with the fact that the weather here is pretty brutal and i dont think it would survive being snowed and rained on. she said no worries and that the spot she cleared is out of the way enough it isnt a bother.
however, after about 6 months, she, with no communication or warning to me, completely freaked out about the dishes and how i was ""poisoning"" all of her kitchenware. she ended up locking literally everything up in big boxes that she then kept in the living room. again, whatever, weird, i wish she had just told me not to use the communal stuff, but i understand she has an allergy. i just shrugged it off and got my own dishes.
she has not stopped escalating this behavior since. she claims that im ""purposefully poisoning and trying to trick"" her, and that i apparently leave the kitchen a complete mess with crumbs everywhere every day. i like to think im a pretty clean person..? maybe not perfect, but i eat mostly microwave meals and wipe the counters down after using them and stuff. especially since i know she has allergies.
in the past month or so she decided to start focusing on the air conditioning, because i asked to have it a little lower since its been in the 90s, and my room gets blasted by the sun half the day (i got blackout curtains and they barely help) so its like 5-10 degrees hotter than the downstairs. she responded by saying she doesnt care and doesnt want the ac ""lower than what it is outside"" (??). i tried to tell her its so hot my cat is showing signs of heat exhaustion and to please have it be a little lower so my room has a chance to cool down. she again didnt care at all, saying ""i pay for half the electrical, so i dont want it on"". as if
i
dont ALSO pay for half of it. she was actually tearing the thermostat off of the wall for a while and hiding it in her room. i would just get an ac unit for my room but im gonna be honest im so poor i can barely afford groceries
shes also been freaking out if i ever leave an empty soda box by the garbage can. its completely out of the way of foot traffic. i dont let them stack up (maybe 2 total boxes at a time) and take them out when i take the trash out. shes been moving them and putting them in the sink, and outside my bedroom door?
lately she has been writing things like ""GET OUT"" and ""youre not welcome here"" on the side of the fridge and the cabinets. as well as turning the HEAT on when its still regularly in the 80s-90s outside. shes also been putting soap and wax on the kitchen chairs? i can only assume in hopes i sit down and ruin a pair of pants?? shes also thrown my waffle maker on the counter and broke it, and put wax on my shoes. so shes damaging my belongings.
shes also suddenly decided, like two weeks ago out of the blue, that she hates my bike and that ""vehicles belong outside"", and has been randomly moving it around downstairs and frequently ripping the charger for it out of the wall while doing so. i tried to explain to her again that i would put it outside if i could, and if its in the way to let me know, but to please not break the charger. she didnt care.
any time i try to communicate with her literally at all she starts screaming. like top of her lungs yelling. ive actually reported a bunch of this to my leasing office, since its gotten to the point shes breaking my things and yelling at me and i feel properly unsafe, rather than her just being kind of passive aggressive. the office did absolutely nothing when they came over. when they came in they said they ""skimmed"" my email, and seemingly instantly went to her. the only thing they heard me out about was, when she claimed i was ""putting
garbage
on the floor next to the bin"", i explained that it was empty cardboard boxes. and they said that is normal to do and its unnecessary to make a long trip to the dumpster every single time.
yesterday, she moved an empty box again, and i, admittedly extremely frustrated, but trying to be civil, told her to please stop moving them. she instantly exploded at me and yelled ""well its not that hard to take it to the dumpster"". i tried to remind her that the office themselves said that was unnecessary. and she responded by saying the office guy is a ""lazy slob"" too. my boyfriend was visiting and sitting at the counter at the time, and tried to tell her that her dog was cowering and shivering under his chair because shes screaming. she just responded by saying ""awww are you scared too?"". she tried to drag her boyfriend into it as well, who had stepped outside and come back in visibly nervous and confused as to why she was yelling. he just awkwardly said he was going to go and then left.
i attached some pictures of her responses on the whiteboard (im the smaller handwriting, if thats not clear), as well as the things shes writing on the cabinets..?? and my wafflemaker she cracked and broke. and my shoes. pictures might be a little out of order, im not sure
i do not know what to do anymore. im hoping to move out of here within a month, but im worried in that time shes going to break or damage more of my stuff, and the office doesnt seem to care about anything shes doing. any ideas on what i can do? even if its something petty? im honestly done trying to be civil, since she clearly cant be reasoned with","['https://preview.redd.it/dtoudy40w8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8498598ffc5a7c7d733c5559778519c8461af6af', 'https://preview.redd.it/8iv1nz40w8jf1.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f6abae1e69db0b4429fc44f1152fdf64183e562e', 'https://preview.redd.it/59lq4z40w8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d904e38722c8886c2b328a3dc47f1cf02c211e9a', 'https://preview.redd.it/ykprntgvw8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b51b21971df51afea7911cec186dab62506c606c', 'https://preview.redd.it/squ3ptd1w8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c3e0504d608654a7600f3f45163adda5d5f6467e', 'https://preview.redd.it/d1ydd2e1w8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5ee3f4cebee438621dab716a02312ddc07afe9b4', 'https://preview.redd.it/wapowtd1w8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=32fc8a0d13c85e398cbd88844f04db862793e73c', 'https://preview.redd.it/nvrk23h2w8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d0d4a57baf9e6760370dd6e90685da30b19bad37', 'https://preview.redd.it/4ws3dlolx8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d9c3fb2abb64d5f4c2f08a9aafa81cf064afad07', 'https://preview.redd.it/oyymhtd1w8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=01efaead47b2e733174cbc91a5b91b4b85cf3a1b', 'https://preview.redd.it/wyzev1dyw8jf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=68eeaf3bfb7ff2a49ff8667c3b6d909361710c81']"

My roommate finally moved out tonight after a sixty day notice because I’m about to have a baby. He’s been notorious for being extremely messy and never showering. He wears the same clothes for WEEKS and my boyfriend and I recently discovered that he is now unemployed. I could go on and on about all the terrible awful things this man has put me through since I allowed him to move into my apartment, but it’s just way too much. I will add that he tried to let his homeless friend live with us under our noses and when I finally said I’d call the cops if I saw said friend, he resorted to allowing his friend live out of his car. So I’d sometimes see his homeless friend wandering the complex. It went from me feeling bad for the dude to just sheer hatred. He took advantage of our kindness and now I’m sitting here, 8 months pregnant wondering wtf I’m supposed to do. Fun little fyi..,his room was going to become my future daughter’s room. He hoarded his poor cat in there for over a year and could barely afford to feed the poor thing so he resorted to stealing my cats food sometimes. My boyfriend and I wondered how the fuck he was cleaning the litter box…well now we know.
Sorry if this is all over the place, I’m still shaking from this entire experience and have been in tears the past hour.
First picture is of outside his window months back btw
The rest is how he left his room tonight after moving out.

I live in off-campus student housing but a family is living under me who aren’t students at our uni. This specific rental company only allows students to live in all their complexes, but they do make exceptions when there are enough units open, especially for people who qualify for low-income housing.
I know Just by reading the note you are confused as to what is wrong why are your neighbors being crazy?  I arrived the the complex to move in at 6 pm since my home town is far from my uni, I CAME IN WITH ABSOLUTELY NO FURNITURE the only thing I arrived with was a mattress, 3 containers filled with necessities, my dog ( a 3 pound Chi), & a dream
I arrived at 6 unloaded left for the store at @7 got back at 7:45 put up groceries. Then I swept the floor to put up & fix my mattress. I will admit I did drop the broom, but that happened before 10 even if I was making noise it was normal living noises that can't be helped I was in my bed ready for bed doom-scrolling by that time I was asleep before 12 😩😩 I have an 8 am class like be so for real a person can't even move into their apartment without somebody complaining its the fact that they said we'll into after 12 LIKE BROOO I WAS ASLEEP I do have a roommate but she wasn't up either and already had been moved in she moved in 6months ago she's been telling me how they have left 2 random notes like that before but every time they do it never makes sense to them either they left one about the noise when no one was home for an entire weekend
I have an 8 am class and was up by 6 and they were not awake by 7 their kid was crying his lungs out and I could hear them yelling at him to shut up and go back to sleep 
I just moved in and I can already tell the downstairs neighbors are gonna be a nightmare 😩😩😩
This note pissed me off I know it's dumb I'm this mad but like I am very aware I live in a shitty apartment complex and noise is going to be expected I wouldn't expect people to tip-toe around me just so I'm comfortable that's why I have earplugs this is also student housing you kinda have to expect people constantly moving in and out not only day we are right across the uni so there will always be noise.",https://i.redd.it/jf4oc3tto1dc1.jpeg

He was in his late 40’s I was early 20’s and the other roommate (who found this dude) was in his early 30’s. This was a conversation we had when I was gone on vacation and had asked him to feed my cat (momma) for me. As you can see he texts like a psychopath. At first he was the ideal roommate because he did some kind of work overseas so he paid for two or three months and was never around. He sometimes would talk about how to get more money into other countries than you were allowed to bring.he would occasionally say other weird shit but I mostly ignored him. Shortly after I got back from this vacation I asked him to do his dishes because it smelled really gross in the kitchen. He grabbed his gun and threatened to shoot me and leave my body in the desert saying “I don’t give a FUCK. I’ve done it before I can do it again” fortunately I moved out shortly after. My cat was fine btw she had just slipped outside and since she only liked me, she ignored him calling for her. I had a friend go over and put food out for her, but before I had her she was an outdoor cat so she could take care of herself. ANYWAY. After I left it got weirder. They added another roommate who was a dude I said I absolutely wouldn’t live with. I guess at some point it ended with the new roommate pulling a knife on the psycho guy who pulled a gun and the third roommate was just stuck in the middle. The two got arrested but were released. Eventually the psycho dude ended up in jail for allegedly assaulting a child. this was when me and the other guy who had been living at the house together found out he had lied to us about his name and identity. He then allegedly killed himself in jail, but for a variety of reasons me and the other old roommate suspect he is actually still alive.

Alright, so this week I (23F) was in the kitchen on facetime with my siblings. My roommate (24F) comes into the kitchen and immediately starts an argument with me. To preface, for the most part we buy groceries and other household stuff together. Recently I decided to buy a jug of canola oil and some seasoning for myself because I do a lot of home cooking and I wanted two things I could use separately, so I put it in my cabinet. She starts talking about how she went through my cabinet and how disrespectful I am for buying seasoning and oil for myself (even though I was the one who bought it for the house the past three times) and that she’s been using mine and is going to continue to use it. Obviously I’m taken aback by why she’s even going through my stuff and I say “I’m allowed to buy stuff that’s just for me. It’s not disrespectful but it IS disrespectful to go through my things without asking because I don’t do that to you. You’re not gonna keep using my personal belongings.” After I say that she says “Well, I guess neither of us are gonna use it.” and throws everything I have in my cabinet on the ground.
So immediately I’m upset over this and I tell her she needs to clean this up, to which she says “you can clean it up yourself” and I let her know how childish this was. She continues yelling at me then leaves the room so I tell her that I’m gonna tell someone that she did this because this isn’t okay, then she comes back to yell at me again and pushes me full force into the wall. At this point I’m running on emotions and tell her I’m gonna call the police if she puts hands on me again. I then leave the apartment and go to call her mom to de-escalate. Her mom tells me that I was in the wrong because I “should have communicated that I bought stuff for myself and put it in my cabinet” and starts to say “Oh, well I know she was having a really bad day which isn’t an excuse but it’s a reason.” While talking to her mom, my roommate calls me a “tattle tale” and a “liar” and says I’m always playing the victim.
After this I update my mom and call her and my siblings again when I get back in the house, then my roommate comes out of her room again to start arguing with me. She kept getting in my face, putting her hands on me and screaming in my face. She then tells me I’m “a terrible roommate, a scary ass hoe and a stupid bitch” then she says “I HATE YOU” Afterwards she continues to push me into the wall, tries to hit me with a fist and threatens to punch me in my throat. She then says that her reaction and response to what she did was valid and that I’m the only issue in this apartment. When I finally decide to stand up for myself she puts her mom on facetime and tells her I’m antagonizing her. I leave to another room and call both her mom and my mother to figure out what my next move should be but her mom just keeps saying I need to stay out of her way and that I’m instigating. I had to stay out of the house for 4+ hours until she left because both our parents were unsure if something would happen if I went back inside.
Honestly I never thought it would escalate to this over me buying my own stuff but idk what to do now. Clearly she has no issue assaulting me so idk if I feel safe here but I also don’t want her to go to jail.",https://i.redd.it/a81puvk67boc1.jpeg

Recently, I decided to smoke some weed and watch the Vince-Staples show which is great imo. And he joins me and ask for a few puffs which is cool. Eventually he falls asleep and i just carry on watching until like 3 am when I decide to go to sleep.
As I get up he wakes up and just makes regular convo, after a minute or two I tell him I’m gonna head to bed and wish him a good night.
Tell me why as I’m on the toilet high as fuck at 3 AM this guy asks me if I want a blowjob? Even after declining he doubles down and says to just let him know if I ever reconsider. I should have mentioned but yea he’s obviously gay but also I have a girlfriend who comes round almost every week.
Wtf do I do now? It’s made me really uncomfortable and basically made me rethink this living situation. I used to cook meals for like 3 days because I workout a lot and let him have some now even that seems odd to me.
He’s also starting to send me Goodmorning messages like he’s my girl or something. Tbf this happened before but with a girl so I decided not to live with women anymore but this is just as bad if not worse.",
badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/18emrl1/landlordroommates_were_taking_advantage_of_me/,4611,514,Landlord/roommates were taking advantage of me,"This is from about a year and a half ago before I moved out and bought my current house, me and my girlfriend were living with my ex friend and his girlfriend, and the house was in her name.
I had moved in summer of 2019, cheap rent, but house was in pretty piss poor condition, but I wanted to move out just to be on my own. When covid hit, all 3 of us (me, friend and his gf) ended up on unemployment, I found a job at Amazon soon after but they wanted to stay on unemployment just to not work and make the extra money they got from it. In summer of 2020 they decided to buy a Rv (for like 6000, so it was not a good rv by any means), and travel the country while on unemployment. In October of 2020 my girlfriend moved in with me, and we signed a new month to month lease stating we'd be the only 2 in the house, take care of all utilities ourselves, etc.
In early summer/late spring of 2021, they moved back in because their rv broke down (of course, anyone with a brain could've guessed that would happen), but they never changed the lease and I am not confrontational and just went with it (mistake on my part). I knew they were still on unemployment and making very little money, so I decided to just continue paying all utilities myself, even though they both lived there, and I never said anything because I thought I was just being a good friend.
Flash forward to spring of 2022, I'm in the process of buying my house, getting everything settled, they have jobs now but still aren't paying anything for utilities or anything. I decide to message my friend one day and ask if he'd be willing to pay half of the utilities until we move out so I can free up some money to help repair my house i was buying and get stuff it needs. He instantly says something along the lines of ""it says in the lease the utilities are your responsibility"". Instantly I was fuming, but I just took some deep breaths, said okay, didn't message anything else about it, even though I know the lease was pretty much null as it stated it was only supposed to be me and my girlfriend in the house.
A couple weeks later, as we get the keys to our house and begin working on it as fast as we can so we can leave. I had no plans to pay anything that month, none of the utilities or rent. I didn't tell them this, I was done with them and just going to let them figure it out. Eventually his girlfriend tries to set up a meeting with me to talk, I knew exactly what she wanted to talk about as the due dates for the utilities was coming up and it hasn't been paid, so I kept blowing her off. When she sent me the second to last text about how the login hasn't changed, me and my girlfriend decided right then and there, in the middle of the night, to grab all our shit and move out even though we really wanted to wait a couple more days. Called up a few friends with trucks, loaded everything up, made a few trips, took to about 630-7 am and we were finally free and away from them in our new house.
The last text is what his girlfriend sent after they realized we moved out. The key she's talking about was the spare key I had made for my girlfriend, I paid for it so I wasn't giving it to them, broke it and threw it out.

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1irl93c/my_housemate_is_convinced_my_glasses_are_hers/,4307,923,My housemate is convinced my glasses are hers,"(Need advice) First time posting on reddit so please bear with me.
My housemate (25f) and I (24f) have gotten into the dumbest argument and I genuinely don’t know how to navigate so please give me some advice. To preface this is the start of our third year living together and there’s always been issues with her being unreasonable and honestly just rude. I’ve kinda just ignored everything else or tried to deal with it as amicably as I can but this has sent me over the edge and I’m just sick of it.
I have had rosemary propagating in one of my glasses and I get a text message from her with a picture of my glass saying “don’t use these cups as vases” to which I’m like what why not? because in my head why can’t I do what I want with my own glasses?
Then she says that they’re her glasses and she doesn’t want them to be used for anything else but for drinking. At this point I’m so confused because I have never seen any glasses like these apart from mine in the house (they’re kind of tall tumbler cocktail glasses with diamond patterns around). So I reply saying, “they’re definitely mine ahaha what, I even have the matching shot glasses” because I literally do?
She replies “wym they’re definitely yours, like I just made it up, you met them here. Maybe you have shot glasses like them but these glasses are mine and please don’t use them as vases.”
I tried to explain that my friend bought me the glasses for my birthday a few years ago and they came in a set of two but one was broken when I opened the box so she bought me another pair and that’s why there’s only 3 there, and I saw matching shot glasses like literal matching from the same store and I bought them before I even moved into the place I’m at now. So unless we do have the same glasses then I apologise but I know 100% that I have the same so I assumed the one I was using was mine.
She replies with “look I’m not finding this sick joke funny. Whoever gave you yours to you is not my concern. The three glasses in the cupboard are 1000% mine and have been in this house since before you moved in ask (previous housemate) and (current housemate). They were gifted to me in 2020 by someone who supported me after my dad passed, along with a few other house items. They have a lot of sentimental value even though they leak, so while I normally wouldn't speak up about you using my other glasses as vases like you have in the past, I will not allow it for these ones. I also don't appreciate that you laughed about it but whatever. For the last time don't use my drinking glasses as vases, all of them in fact.
Go and look for where you kept yours and use them as vases.
The beer glasses were given to me by the same person. These are not even glass styles that I would normally buy for myself but they were given to me at a very crucial time in my life, so for you to tell me that ""they're definitely yours ahahaha"" like we're playing here or something. Don't let me crash out because of fucking glasses because I will.”
And while I am empathetic to her I feel like I’m losing my mind because I know these are mine and so I spent ages trying to find a picture of them from before I moved into the current place. And I do find a picture and video of the broken glass from the first set from December 2021 and it is the exact same glass I swear. I sent her the picture with the date and the video saying, “I am 100% sure those are mine, here’s a video of the fourth glass that was broken in 2021.”
She replied saying that it doesn’t automatically make the ones in this house yours, and that the glass of the broken glass is thick. 
Which by the way the glass is broken at the base where the indentations are so of course it would be thicker than the rim. And she emphasises her previous message that says “go and look for where you kept yours and use them as vases.”
I don’t know where to go from here I would’ve thought that proof of the glasses would be enough and especially the explanation of there being 3 glasses because glasses aren’t normally sold in odd numbers.

i go inside to pee and i see her shit unflushed—so i snap a pic and send it to her and say “you forgot to flush”
she then goes off on me. and lies…..about a friend dying…..and lies….about trying to not cause issues with me….after she has been distruptive while i was sleeping, talked about me in ear shot with other roommates, thrown away our roommate agreement, has not picked up after herself and not taken out her trash on her designated day to take out the trash, and has erased our agreed chore chart. I say this as a brief mention to say that she is trying to provoke me (i know this because she has literally apologized for doing this to me—and i have done quite LITERALLY nothing to her BUT asked her to pick up after herself once to take out the trash and today to flush after herself)
I legit come in to sleep and shower, leave for the day, come back. And i asked her….to flush the toilet. and this is how she responds. so done. i blocked her while she was typing the last message because i don’t care to hear from her again.
cannot wait to move out.","['https://preview.redd.it/y39xp9xjrpkc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8b16f975146ad92b8b10597a022e9b423689d332', 'https://preview.redd.it/vwn1x8xjrpkc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4bdd899d0df86c3fa9a8bb2ced78e3dae6ed6e03']"

My parents are in Australia and the hospital could not reach her so none of us knew she has been ill.

This woman is 40 years old and constantly says she’d have the rent but after 3 months my sister filed to evict her and is suing in small claims court. The audacity of this bitch while my sister is critically ill to call her room a mess and ask for bedsheets as if that equals not paying rent is baffling.

Last month my roommate reached out to me and let me know she was having issues with her “payroll system” and wouldn’t be able to cover her rent. I offered to cover her as it’s never been an issue with her actually paying rent or bills.
Since the 6th I’ve been asking her about her paycheck and she just beats around the bush about it, and states that they’re running behind or another excuse (Once the 7th came I realized she might be lying about it all) I let a few days go by until this morning I realized I am down to my very last dollar and decided to approach her again. This was the response I got.. for context yes I did donate my kidney and when disability didn’t kick in right away with my job she covered me for a week until it was sorted out. I also work part time now that winter session has started for me, so I’m not making as much as I usually do. I know the general thumb rule is don’t lend out what you can’t afford to lose, at the time I thought I didn’t have anything to lose. Boy was I wrong.

Pee on the seats every day, no trash getting taken out, dirty dishes, messy house, finishing my food because no one else has money. His brother also has a dog that owes and poops everywhere that he will leave for days/weeks. My best friend hasn’t had a job since January and rent day is always stressful. When his brother moved in we have had to help pay rent ever since. We almost got our gas and water shut off because no one has money except me. I go to work just to come home and see them chilling on the couch and it makes me so angry.
A few weeks ago I saw the dog peed by the steps and asked his brother to clean it up to which he came downstairs and screamed at me for 5 minutes. After that I just want to leave. Today we got into another argument (texts) and now I feel like I’m being gaslit because the brother is acting so nice all of a sudden and now my best friend is basically telling me if I leave he’s gonna end it. They cleaned up the house but I know it’s just going to go back to the way it was and I think I’m being majorly manipulated.

I’m over it.,"When I first moved into my off-campus apartment with three other girls, things were fine. We weren’t best friends, but we were friendly watched movies, cooked together, had a decent vibe.
Then the boundary issues started. First it was little things: snacks disappearing, shampoo running out twice as fast, laundry detergent mysteriously gone. When I brought it up, they’d laugh, deny it, or promise to replace it (never happened).
Then it got bigger. I saw one roommate wearing my wristwatch on Snapchat without asking. Another time, I came home to strangers sleeping in my bed. They also loved to use my special cooking tools (that I bought myself) and leave them greasy or slightly damaged.
That’s when I finally locked everything down bought a lockbox, a mini fridge, and started locking my bedroom door. They called me “paranoid” and “dramatic,” but honestly, it was the only way to have peace of mind.
At first, it seemed to work. Things were tense, but they eventually apologized, and I thought maybe we’d turned a corner. Then, two days later, one roommate literally broke into my locked room to grab makeup because she “really needed it.” I wish I was exaggerating, but nope.
That was the final straw. My family’s coming to help me pack up, and I’m leaving. I don’t care if the lease overlap is a headache I’m not living with people who think breaking into my room is acceptable behavior.",

He also didn’t supply ANYTHING for the place — me and A furnished it, we own all the pots, pans, silverware, cups, plates, bowls, bath mats, sponges, TP, paper towels you name it.

our rent is $1740, and me and A pay an extra $35/month for our cats. We mail in our rent check every month. A normally does it but I did it when she was out of town. F would always send his payment split up between cash and Venmo but I always assumed he was sending the right amount, which was stupid of me.
